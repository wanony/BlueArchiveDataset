# Dataset for Blue Archive Story Transcript

I would like to extend a big thanks to the people who have typed this out, and managed to effectively convey the story of Blue Archive.

This data was taken from the [Blue Archive Archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-BDFl1e5GNOPMyK5Mn1teZ-RkrGeZtC0uyGDkwwRdM/edit#heading=h.c277l1wc38tm), and will be updated as they release new chapters.

# Installation

Clone the repository, and adjust the scripts as needed. Everything currently works fine with Python 3.9, no extra dependancies needed.
