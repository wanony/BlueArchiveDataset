[Chapter 4]: Kyrie of the Forgotten Gods
[Chapter 4]: The Arius Squad has been abandoned. Will there be mercy for students who are lost to its teachings of hatred and anger?
[Chapter 4]: 01 - Prologue
[Chapter 4]: The Arius Squad reach  their limit after endless pursuit. Hoping to save the other three, Atsuko surrenders and is arrested. But what awaits the remaining members?
[???]: Over there!
[???]: Don’t let them get away!
[???]: Shooting and running
[???]: It’s a dead end! What about the other way?
[???]: There are no exits. We’re completely surrounded.
[???]: Ugh…
[Arius Student A]: Surrender, Squad. You’ve run out of options.
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: I’m gonna c-cry…!
[Atsuko]: *inhale* *sign language* *exhale*
[Misaki]: We’re low on ammo and we’ve nearly eighty hours into this fight. Everyone is at their limit.
[Misaki]: And Leader is too badly injured. Every minute we dawdle is a risk to her life.
[Saori]: Don’t worry about me. Take a look at this.
[Hiyori]: Y-Y-You can’t be serious, Saori!
[Misaki]: That bomb can destroy halos. I agree with Hiyori.
[Saori]: I didn’t ask for your opinion! I’ll distract them. Just get Hime out of here.
[Atsuko]: …Saori.
[Saori]: Escape with her…and after that…
[Saori]: After that…
[Atsuko]: Saori.
[Saori]: Hime?!
[Atsuko]: You’ve all worked so hard. Thank you.
[Misako]: …
[Hiyori]: Hime… I-I don’t like this….
[Atsuko]: You there. Your master is only after me, correct?
[Atsuko]: I will come quietly. But let the others go.
[Arius Student A]: …
[Saori]: Atsuko?! Are you insane?
[Atsuko]: Saori, we’ve reached the end of the road.
[Atsuko]: Say we do find some way to escape. What then? Where will we run?
[Saori]: I’ll find somewhere, anywhere. I can protect you, Atsuko!
[Atsuko]: With Trinity, Gehenna, and Arius all after our blood?
[Atsuko]: Nowhere is safe, Saori. There will be no rest for the four of us.
[Atsuko]: Saori. Misaki. Hiyori. I hold all the blame here.
[Atsuko]: So, please. Let me hold the responsibility as well.
[Hiyori]: Hime… I-I don’t like this…
[Misaki]: …Hime.
[Saori]: No! She’ll kill you, Atsuko! Do you hear me? You’re dead the moment you arrive!
[Atsuko]: And that’s my decision to make. Saori, for the first time, I’m making my own choices. Please.
[Atsuko]: Promise me you’ll free the others, and I’ll come with you.
[Arius Student A]: …
[Arius Student A]: I will ask Madame for her decision.
[???]: (static) Hmm.
[???]: (static) …I see. You have my word.
[Atsuko]: Swear on your name.
[???]: (static) My name? Why would I do that?
[Atsuko]: Swear on your name you will not harm them.
[???]: (static) …I swear on my name, Beatrice, visionary of all pilgrims.
[Atsuko]: Okay. Then, I surrender.
[Arius Student B]: Mask on, Hime. Madame’s orders. It shouldn't have been taken off to begin with.
[Beatrice]: (static) Deliver her to me without so much as a scratch. The ritual begins at sunrise tomorrow.
[Atsuko]: Everyone… Saori. Take care of yourselves. This is goodbye.
[Misaki]: Hime…
[Hiyori]: Oh no…
[Hiyori]: Arius students and Atsuko walk away
[Saori]: Atsuko… No… Come back…!
[Saori]: I have to protect you…
[Saori]: If I can’t…! If you disappear…!
[Saori]: What would I do?
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: What do I do without you, Atsuko?
[Saori]: What the hell have I been doing all this time?
[Saori]: Is there anything for me…to live for?
[Arius Student A]: (static) …The rest of the squad, ma’am?
[Beatrice]: (static) Erase them.
[Arius Student A]: Understood.
[Arius Student A]: Permission to fire at will.
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Gunshots
[Saori]: <<To be Continued>>
[Saori]: 02 - Uncomfortable Reception
[Saori]: In the name of helping the Tea Party, Sakurako from Sisterhood and Mine from the Remedial Knights join Nagisa. During an awkward tea party, Nagisa informs Sensei that Mika’s hearing will be held the next day, where she will likely be expelled.
[Nagisa]: It’s been quite some time. Thank you for coming, Sensei.
[Sensei]: “Of course. Hello, everyone.”
[Sakurako]: A pleasure, [NAME] Sensei. We still owe you one from last time.
[Mine]: …Nice to meet you. I’m Mine, captain of the Remedial Knights.
[Sensei]: “The pleasure’s mine. I get to witness an interesting trio.” / “We have an interesting combination here.”
[Sakurako]: Haha… Nagisa would probably call it troublesome.
[Mine]: I am not here to antagonize Nagisa.
[Mine]: The Knights stand up for our convictions and beliefs. If I see a wrong, I set it right. That is all.
[Mine]: Regardless of who the culprit may be.
[Nagisa]: …
[Sakurako]: …Those kind of words are gonna get someone in trouble.
[Nagisa]: That’s enough chit-chat. I’m sure Sensei is busy.
[Nagisa]: Sensei, I invited you here to update you on the situation at Trinity since the Eden Treaty incident and discuss our next steps. However…
[Sakurako]: …
[Mine]: …
[Nagisa]: For reasons somewhat incomprehensible to me, the leaders of the Sisterhood and the Remedial Knights demanded a seat at the table. So, here we are.
[Sakurako]: Demand is a harsh word.The Sisterhood’s newfound political status means we should be involved in meetings like this.
[Mine]: As the leader of the Remedial Knights, the oldest club in Trinity’s history, I’m only fulfilling my duty.
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: “In other words, you’re policing the Tea Party?”
[Sakurako]: No, no. I’m just keeping up with current events.
[Mine]: And I have no interest in politics.
[Sakurako]: The Eden Treaty incident may have concluded safely, but there’s a lot of follow-up and post-analysis still in process.
[Sakurako]: The Sisterhood is helping out and conducting some of the research analysis.
[Sakurako]: And this meeting’s purpose is to share information on said topics.
[Mine]: She is correct.
[Sensei]: “O-Okay… I see.”
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: You seemed confused. You see, we could not simply leave this to the Tea Party.
[Mine]: The Party’s state is fragile right now.
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: It is absolutely unprecedented for an active member of the Tea Party to be arrested. And even more so for one to attack another.
[Mine]: Imagine my shock when I discovered Mika was behind the attack on Seia.
[Nagisa]: …
[Sakurako]: …
[Mine]: As you well know, Seia has been under my protection since. I thought it only right to investigate the case myself.
[Mine]: Arguing that Mika was taken advantage of by Arius does not absolve her of her crimes.
[Mine]: And, on top of that, the current host manipulated Schale’s extrajudicial authority to meet her own ends and expel students she disfavored.
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: I understand you apologized and no harm was done, but…
[Mine]: It casts a dark shadow on the Tea Party.
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: It was a blessing Seia awoke at all. But since, her health has steadily declined and now she is bedridden.
[Mine]: And so, it was my conclusion the Tea Party required our assistance.
[Sakurako]: Indeed.
[Nagisa]: What a clear, thorough explanation, Captain Mine. You truly never change.
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: (Well, this is awkward.)
[Sakurako]: Captain Mine is leader of the Johan faction and head of the Remedial Knights.
[Sakurako]: She had the right to attend the Tea Party, but she declined in favor of her medical career. It’s rather sweet.
[Mine]: Let’s not waste time reminiscing, Sakurako.
[Nagisa]: I’ll begin. At the core of this incident is the Arius Satellite School.
[Nagisa]: We have confirmed that the perpetrator of the Eden Treaty incident was indeed Arius.
[Nagisa]: They coordinated their infiltrations by apparently deceiving Chair Makoto and Mika.
[Nagisa]: In fact, Chair Makoto goes so far as to claim she’s Trinity’s victim, seeing as Arius is a faction of Trinity.
[Nagisa]: She was mumbling some nonsense about billing us for her hairdressing expenses, but I believe that can be ignored.
[Sakurako]: It’s Arius’ involvement that leaves the Sisterhood with questions.
[Sakurako]: To begin, what was Arius’ motivation in attacking the Eden Treaty ceremony?
[Mine]: Arius has long held a grudge against Trinity and Gehenna. They saw the opportunity to suppress both academies at once and took it.
[Nagisa]: According to Seia, by invoking the Eden Treaty contract, they obtain an overwhelming military force.
[Mine]: Yes, a force comprised of what seemed to be ghosts of the Saint Justina Council. Had they not been stopped when they had, both Trinity and Gehenna would have crumbled.
[Sakurako]: …
[Mine]: What do you know of those things?
[Nagisa]: We don’t have a grain of evidence. Only educated guesses.
[Mine]: Fine. The Council is the Sisterhood’s predecessor. Are you holding something back, Sakurako?
[Sakurako]: Unfortunately, I know just as much as you do.
[Mine]: I cannot ignore that the Sisterhood is held together by secrets. You are long practiced in manipulating and hiding information.
[Mine]: It’s only natural that many students at Trinity have lost faith in the Sisterhood.
[Sakurako]: Like you, Captain Mine?
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: …
[Sensei]: (...Can I leave?)
[Sakurako]: You’re a fool if you believe me to be the Sisterhood’s sole secret keeper.
[Sakurako]: There are plenty of things I don’t know. I can’t say much more than that.
[Mine]: I spoke of ignorance. My apologies.
[Nagisa]: Oh, dear…
[Mine]: Moving on to the next order of business. Is the analysis finished on the missile that neutralized our defense system?
[Nagisa]: Nothing came of it, unfortunately. Its materials and technology are foreign to us. Wherever it came from, it wasn’t Kivotos.
[Mine]: That’s of no surprise. The Arius Satellite School is in possession of at least two powerful resources we know nothing about.
[Sakurako]: Which leads to my next question.
[Sakurako]: What intel do you have on Arius’ plans?
[Mine]: …
[Nagisa]: We’ve been unable to discover anything.
[Nagisa]: We can’t even locate the Arius district, let alone gather intel.
[Sakurako]: Their whereabouts have been a longstanding mystery. But I did uncover a few clues.
[Sakurako]: During the Eden Treaty incident, they infiltrated through the underground catacombs.
[Sakurako]: All previous Arius infiltrations can be traced back to the catacombs too. To top it off, the cruise missile was launched from a ruins district in Trinity.
[Mine]: The underground ruins? It’s a massive network. We’d never be able to take control of them.
[Nagisa]: Besides, those tunnels are a maze. It’d be an impossible mission to find them down there.
[Mine]: Hm…
[Nagisa]: Seia believes the district could be protected by some incomprehensible force.
[Nagisa]: She doesn't see how else they could be so undetectable.
[Mine]: More things we don’t understand…
[Nagisa]: Azusa, who defected from Arius, said she was given a map of the catacombs with a marked exit route for her missions.
[Nagisa]: !
[Nagisa]: But she was provided different route every time, so she doesn’t know a way back to the Arius district.
[Mine]: You interrogated her?!
[Nagisa]: Wh-What?
[Mine]: I’ll ask again. Did you force Shirasu Azusa to give you information?
[Mine]: She is branded a traitor in the only home she’s ever known, for helping us. How dare you put her through more hardship?
[Mine]: She was finally settling in here! And you re-open old wounds for your own benefit? It’s thoughtless and cruel.
[Nagisa]: Y-You misunderstand! She volunteered the information.
[Mine]: I highly doubt that! Did you coerce her? Threaten her with the Tea Party’s authority?
[Nagisa]: Excuse me?!
[Sakurako]: Check yourself, Captain Mine. Your accusations hold no ground.
[Mine]: You’ve confirmed this?
[Sakurako]: Yes. I know Nagisa has done some reprehensible things, but Azusa was never treated poorly.
[Sakurako]: At the very least, that Sensei over there would never let anyone touch a hair on her head.
[Mine]: …I see.
[Mine]: I owe you an apology, Nagisa.
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: (Nagisa’s tea cup is shaking…) / “Are you okay, Nagisa?”
[Nagisa]: It’s not that I don’t understand.
[Nagisa]: Hanako, Koharu, Azusa, and…Hifumi.
[Nagisa]: Each member of the Make-Up Work Club is shouldering much more than they were ever meant to.
[Nagisa]: Their burdens are a result of my actions.
[Nagisa]: I’m not completely shameless. I know what I did.
[Nagisa]: I’ve done my utmost to keep them out of the spotlight as we clean up this mess.
[Nagisa]: I’d like to protect them from experiencing something like that again. After all, this is our responsibility.
[Sensei]: “Nagisa…”
[Mine]: I am of the same mind. I spoke without thinking, once again.
[Sakurako]: I’m glad we’re on the same page.
[Sakurako]: I was hoping to begin passing responsibilities to Hanako, but…
[Sakurako]: Our contract is complete, and I won’t force her into it.
[Sakurako]: So, this fight is ours. It’s the least we can do for them.
[Sakurako]: But, I have a feeling a certain teacher will be with us until the end.
[Sensei]: “Reporting for duty.”
[Nagisa]: …Thank you, Sensei.
[Nagisa]: Change scene
[Mine]: The catacombs are huge mazes of unknown magnitude. Finding a moving entrance will be a problem.
[Sakurako]: Unless we ask someone who is familiar with the passages.
[Mine]: Do you have someone in mind?
[Mine]: Fade to black
[Sakurako]: Joumae Saori, the leader of the Arius Squad who coordinated the attack, must know the way.
[Mine]: Indeed. It was Saori who executed their strategy.
[Nagisa]: We haven’t been able to locate Squad. They’ve likely fled the district.
[Sakurako]: …I can think of someone else.
[Mine]: …
[Nagisa]: You can? Who could possibly…
[Sakurako]: Misono Mika.
[Nagisa]: What!?
[Nagisa]: Fade back to scene
[Nagisa]: Mika said she didn’t know the Arius District’s location.
[Sakurako]: She’s been working with Arius for a long time. Do you really think she would have no idea?
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: We have records of Mika contacting Arius students to coordinate supply deliveries.
[Mine]: We can only assume she reached out to Arius to garner support for a coup.
[Nagisa]: But, Mika is…
[Mine]: Mika’s reputation and conduct over the years have not been commendable.
[Mine]: You know Mika hid behind the shield of the Tea Party to cover up her mistakes and avoid problems.
[Mine]: The condemnation, protests, and public opinion against mika are the result of a long, built-up frustration towards her actions.
[Sensei]: (...Protests? What’s been happening?)
[Nagisa]: Mika wouldn’t lie about this. What would her motive be?
[Sakurako]: …
[Mine]: I understand how you feel about Mika, Nagisa.
[Mine]: To my understanding, your friendship with her spans all the way back to your childhood.
[Nagisa]: …
[Mine]: I’m sorry if this is rude, but please be honest. Do you think Mika is still hiding something?
[Mine]: Fade to black
[Mine]: Fade back
[Nagisa]: If she’s hiding something…
[Sensei]: (Nagisa…)
[Nagisa]: No. I trust Mika.
[Sakurako]: …
[Mine]: …
[Nagisa]: I can’t reasonably argue she’s been a model student.
[Nagisa]: But I understand what it means to believe in someone now!
[Nagisa]: I’ll convince everyone else to trust Mika as well! I’ll defend her at the hearing tomorrow…
[Nagisa]: …Against anyone who accuses her! I’ll fight the entire academy if needed!
[Nagisa]: Consequences be damned!
[Sakurako]: I was just going through every possibility, Nagisa. No accusations here.
[Mine]: We’ve touched a sensitive topic. Apologies.
[Sensei]: “How you doing there, Nagisa?”
[Nagisa]: *sigh*
[Nagisa]: Please don’t worry. But I think that about wraps up.
[Nagisa]: Thank you both for your attendance today. Truly.
[Mine]: Yes, thank you for accepting my request to join this meeting.
[Mine]: I do warn you, however. I’m very concerned about the outpouring of anger towards Mika.
[Mine]: I’ll see if I can do anything to help her. Until next time.
[Sakurako]: I’ll take my leave as well.
[Nagisa]: I apologize I can’t escort you. Safe travels.
[Nagisa]: Sakurako and Mine leave
[Nagisa]: *sigh*
[Nagisa]: Urgh. My stomach hurts.
[Sensei]: “You did great, Nagisa.”
[Nagisa]: Thank you, Sensei. You keep seeing sides of me I don’t mean to show.
[Sensei]: “By the way…what happened to Mika?” / “Mika’s situation sounded serious.”
[Nagisa]: Oh, yes. I suppose you wouldn’t know.
[Nagisa]: Mika’s hearing will be held tomorrow morning.
[Sensei]: “Why is she having a hearing?!”
[Nagisa]: Well, it’s more so…a dispensing of disciplinary action, overseen by an advisory committee of sorts.
[Nagisa]: They’ll present and discuss Mika’s crimes and injustices, especially in relation to the Eden Treaty.
[Nagisa]: …
[Nagisa]: Black screen
[Nagisa]: …Sensei.
[Nagisa]: Fade back
[Nagisa]: Mika is going to be expelled.
[Nagisa]: <<To be Continued>>
[Nagisa]: 03 - Jailed Princess
[Sensei heads to the academy’s prison to talk to Mika. She is upset and blaming herself, saying Seia had yet to forgive her. Sensei learns that Seia is not doing well, so they head to Seia’s room. There, Seia gives Sensei a terrifying prophecy]: all of Kivotos will be destroyed.
[Nagisa]: Since the Eden Treaty incident, the situation at the Trinity Academy is…precarious at best.
[Nagisa]: The public’s opinion of Mika is steadily declining.
[Nagisa]: She’s already been expelled by her supporters in the Pater faction, and it was confirmed that she’ll be dismissed from the Tea Party at the hearing tomorrow.
[Nagisa]: People are convinced Mika is the main culprit in colluding with the Arius Academy to bring about the Eden Treaty incident.
[Sensei]: “...!”
[Nagisa]: There have been riots demanding her dismissal, not to mention stones and even bombs being thrown through her prison window.
[Nagisa]: The academy bulletin board was flooded with criticisms about Mika… They’ve utterly vandalized her room in anger.
[Nagisa]: Her clothes and accessories were burned, and her belongings pifered. THe perpetrators haven’t been caught.
[Sensei]: “They’re going way too far!”
[Nagisa]: …Yes. The Justice Task Force is doing their best, but we can only do so much against this mob mentality.
[Sensei]: “They don’t even know the whole story.” / “I can’t believe this…”
[Nagisa]: Mika has become public enemy number one in Trinity.
[Nagisa]: The student body may think all of this is the price Mika must pay, but…
[Nagisa]: The punishment doesn’t fit the crime. I want to help her.
[Sensei]: “I’ll help. Just tell me what to do.” / “Is there anything I can do?”
[Nagisa]: I thought you would say that.
[Nagisa]: But I don’t think Mika is willing to defend herself.
[Sensei]: “What? Why not?”
[Nagisa]: She refuses to even attend the hearing. If she isn’t present… Well, it’ll be an automatic expulsion.
[Nagisa]: I wish there was something I could do to convince her, but…
[Nagisa]: If Seia were able to be here, I’m sure she could do something…
[Nagisa]: …
[Nagisa]: So, I have a favor to ask of you.
[Sensei]: “Yes. I’ll try to convince Mika.”
[Sensei]: Nagisa glimmers
[Nagisa]: Thank you, Sensei. I think she’ll listen to you.
[Nagisa]: She won’t admit it, but she’s been waiting for your visit.
[Nagisa]: *sigh*
[Nagisa]: That’s at least a little of my plate, even if nothing’s been resolved yet.
[Sensei]: “Are you okay, Nagisa?”
[Nagisa]: Me? Oh, yes…
[Nagisa]: Somehow, I always will be.
[Nagisa]: Heehee. I can always count on you to worry about me. Thank you.
[Nagisa]: Anyway… Good luck, Sensei.
[Nagisa]: Fade to black
[Nagisa]: I said goodbye to Nagisa and went to go see Mika.
[Trinity Student A]: How dare she attack Seia? Bring her out!
[Trinity Student B]: It’s repulsive that the witch is still part of the Tea Party!
[Trinity Student C]: Hang the traitor!
[Justice Task Force Member]: Stay back! D-Don’t cross the line!
[Trinity Student B]: The traitor must pay for her crimes!
[Sensei]: (Nagisa wasn’t exaggerating…)
[Sensei]: “Mika? It’s me.”
[Mika]: Oh, Sensei. Shhh.
[Sensei]: “...?” / “Is that music?”
[Sensei]: A tune plays
[Sensei]: Mika shuts off the TV
[Mika]: Sorry to keep you waiting. I had to finish chapel. They broadcast it on TV, see?
[Mika]: Don’t you think it’s so mean they still make me take classes while I’m in prison?
[Mika]: I thought I’d at least get out of that.
[Sensei]: “It was beautiful music though.”
[Mika]: You really think so? I find it a bit boring. It’s just that same strange line on repeat: “have mercy on us.”
[Mika]: Kyrie Eleison… Even the Greek sounds bad. Why plead to some guy up there I don’t even know exists?
[Mika]: And it looks weak to ask for pity, you know.
[Mika]: But the melody is nice, I’ll give you that! It’s just an ideological disagreement.
[Mika]: Oh, you know! You’ve never heard me sing, huh Sensei? Do you want a performance?
[Mika]: I don’t normally sing for free, but I’ll make an exception just for you!
[Mika]: Like in the fairy tales where the trapped princess sings to her lover from a tall tower!
[Sensei]: “Except we’re in prison, not a tower.”
[Mika]: And I come crashing back to a harsh reality.
[Mika]: …So what brings you to my humble abode, Sensei?
[Sensei]: “I heard about the situation, Mika.” / “Why don’t you want to attend the hearing?”
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: How’s Nagi been? Is she holding up?
[Mika]: The Sisterhood and Remedial Knights leaders showed up uninvited?
[Mika]: I’m not surprised. A lack of authority is like a vacuum. As the Tea Party’s position diminishes, the lesser forces around it are sucked in.
[Mika]: I’m sure she didn’t expect them to confront the Tea Party so directly like that.
[Mika]: Poor Nagi. Has her stomach been hurting? It always hurts when she’s stressed.
[Sensei]: “Your safety is her biggest concern. I saw the crowds on my way here.”
[Mika]: Ah… You did…
[Mika]: Well, what’s a girl to do? I’ve never been one to care what others think of me anyway.
[Mika]: Nagi thinks she can defend me if I just attend the hearing, but we both now how naive she is.
[Mika]: The Eden Treaty incident did a number on the Tea Party’s authority.
[Mika]: As the public opinion of it dwindles, so does its political power. Obviously, it’s my fault.
[Mika]: And if she really insists on defending me in these conditions…
[Mika]: …the Tea Party, along with Nagi and Seia’s positions will be at risk.
[Mika]: They can’t shoulder that risk for me.
[Mika]: I’ve already cost them too much.
[Sensei]: “You’ll be expelled if you don’t attend.” / “I heard about your room, and your things.”
[Mika]: …
[Sensei]: “I think they’re going too far.”
[Mika]: Y-You think so?
[Mika]: I did mess up more than a little bit this time. Even if I get expelled…
[Mika]: …E-Even if they burned my precious mementos of me and Nagi’s childhood…
[Mika]: …None of it erases what I did. And…Seia still hates me…
[Sensei]: “No, Seia could never hate you.” / “Seia’s already forgiven you.”
[Mika]: No, you don’t understand. I tried to apologize a few times, but she…
[Mika]: The last time I tried…
[Mika]: //flashback scene//
[Mika]: Hi Seia! Looking serious as usual! Did you stay up late again? You have to take better care of your skin. Here, you can use my lotion!
[Seia]: …
[Mika]: S-Seia?
[Mika]: So, um… Actually, I was wondering…
[Mika]: Do you want to eat lunch together? I’m afraid the only thing on the menu in prison is cake rolls though.
[Mika]: Nagi is seriously the meanest! Like seriously? Nothing but cake rolls?
[Seia]: Mika…
[Mika]: Y-Yes?
[Seia]: I’m sorry, but I don’t have time.
[Mika]: O-Oh…? Right! Sorry! You’re probably really busy!
[Seia]: I’m not feeling well. I’m returning to my room.
[Seia]: Seia leaves
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: //flashback end//
[Sensei]: “Seia…”
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Seia’s completely isolated herself. She doesn’t come out, and no one goes in.
[Mika]: She’s always been a bit weak, but she’s been really sick these days.
[Mika]: And I keep hearing things… Like they can hear her crying in her room…
[Mika]: I don’t always really get what Seia’s thinking or saying, but…
[Mika]: I can tell she doesn’t want to make up.
[Sensei]: “There must be some miscommunication.” / “I promise, Seia doesn’t blame you.”
[Mika]: Oh, Sensei. Thanks for trying to make me feel better. I’ve accepted my consequences…
[Mika]: I just wish I could give her a real apology.
[Mika]: But I don’t want to cause her any stress and affect her health…
[Mika]: I don’t know how I’ll go on if anything else bad happens to Seia.
[Sensei]: “I’ll go check on her for you.”
[Mika]: S-Seriously?
[Sensei]: “Of course. I want you to have your chance to apologize.”
[Mika]: …!
[Sensei]: “Then the three of us will go to the hearing together!” / “And all of us will support you at your hearing!”
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: What are you saying, Sensei?
[Mika]: I don’t deserve your help or forgiveness.
[Mika]: I really swore I’d never cry again. What’s wrong with you?
[Mika]: Well…
[Mika]: You win, Sensei.
[Mika]: Since you insist, I’ll have to comply. Time to face the music.
[Sensei]: “I’m proud of you, Mika. Really.”
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: I’ve never really believed in fate… I’d given up on a second chance a long time ago.
[Mika]: Heehee. Maybe I really am a princess trapped in a tower?
[Mika]: !!
[Mika]: Y-You didn’t hear that, Sensei!
[Mika]: Please Take care of Seia, then… Sensei.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: Go to Seia’s room.
[Sensei]: Knocking sounds
[Sensei]: Door opens and closes
[Sensei]: [Seia’s infirmary]
[Seia]: Sensei? Is that you?
[Sensei]: “Seia, you’re so pale! What’s wrong?”
[Seia]: Hm? You’re…alive? How can that…? Is this a dream? Sensei, a-am I awake?
[Sensei]: “What do you mean…?”
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Oh, I’m sorry. I was still waking up.
[Seia]: It slipped my mind. You were meant to visit Trinity today.
[Seia]: I’m sorry again. The line between my dreams and reality has been so blurred lately.
[Seia]: The past, present, and future are all tangled up.
[Seia]: Ah, I’m just babbling.
[Sensei]: “Everyone is worried about you. What’s going on?”
[Seia]: Are they?
[Seia]: I guess I can’t hide it… I’m not doing well.
[Seia]: If I’m to tell you this, no one else can know, okay?
[Seia]: …I’ve been grappling with an impossible problem.
[Sensei]: “Okay, I’m listening.”
[Seia]: This is unlike anything you and I have ever experienced.
[Seia]: Please heed my words carefully.
[Sensei]: “I promise, I will.”
[Seia]: I had a…dream some time ago.
[Seia]: As you know, my dreams are often predictive of the future, as if I’ve entered a piece of reality destined to happen.
[Seia]: While these dreams happen often, this one shook me to my core.
[Seia]: Black screen
[Seia]: Sensei, I saw the fall of Kivotos.
[Seia]: <<To be Continued>>
[Seia]: 04 - Between a Dream and a Mirage
[Seia]: Seia tells Sensei she’s had so many lucid dreams that she can no longer distinguish dreams from reality. She explains that Gematria will cause the fall of Kivotos. Sensei advises her to make amends with Mika first. Seia calls Mika, but faints and encounters Gematria in her dreams.
[Sensei]: “You saw the fall of Kivotos…?”
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Seia (Tea Party): Yes, I witnessed it.
[Seia]: I don’t know when it is going to happen, but I do know how.
[Sensei]: “What did you see?”
[Seia]: An enormous tower emerges from a blood red sky.
[Seia]: It erodes the entire world, enveloping everything with its sinister power. It’s accompanied by an awful screech.
[Seia]: Then, the fragments of our destroyed world rage like a storm, then crumbles into pieces. I remember a black light shining down…
[Seia]: Fade to black
[Seia]: And at last, Kivotos falls.
[Seia]: Not a trace is left behind.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Seia]: My heart hopes it was a nightmare. But it could’ve been anything: a snippet of our past or a vision of the future.
[Seia]: All I’m left with is an endless series of questions. I’m determined to find the answers to them.
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: To learn more, I’ve been venturing into the realm of lucid dreams.
[Seia]: They exist on the edge of reality and dreams, making it difficult to discern the future from the past.
[Seia]: Even when I’m awake I feel like I’m in an endless dream.
[Sensei]: “That sounds dangerous…”
[Seia]: I suppose it may be.
[Seia]: I’ve always been afraid of the future. But I couldn’t run away this time.
[Seia]: I won’t rest untilI find out our fate. This is my responsibility.
[Seia]: The tower… The destruction… It was caused by something outside of Kivotos.
[Seia]: This is my guess…but the cause may be Gematria…
[Seia]: I believe you also know of that mysterious organization.
[Sensei]: “You think Gematria is involved?!”
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Seia]: There has to be some way to stop the apocalypse.
[Sensei]: “Seia.”
[Seia]: Yes?
[Sensei]: “You have to stop this now.” / “This is too dangerous for you alone.”
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Yes, I know. Chasing after such mysterious beings, the danger is very real.
[Sensei]: “On top of that, you can’t keep pushing yourself like this.” / “Just don’t do it alone. We can work together.”
[Seia]: …
[Sensei]: “Someone needs you here in reality a lot more than your dreams do.”
[Sensei]: …
[Seia]: …Mika.
[Seia]: You’re right, Sensei.
[Seia]: I was lost in my dreams and lost focus of what’s important.
[Seia]: I can’t help Mika if something happens to me.
[Seia]: I’ve been foolish.
[Seia]: Mika’s situation is beyond dire.
[Seia]: She might always act like a baby, and she expects the world to cater to her like a princess in her fairy tales…
[Seia]: …But for her to experience something like this for the first time… Being the target of everyone’s hatred…
[Seia]: I don’t know if she can handle it.
[Seia]: Right. Helping Mika is the top priority right now.
[Seia]: How can I have been so blind?
[Seia]: It feels like I’m finally shaking off my dreams. Thank you, Sensei. I must help my friend.
[Sensei]: “Mika will be thrilled. She really wants to apologize.”
[Seia]: Apologize? When I’ve already forgiven her?
[Seia]: Ah. That might’ve been in a dream.
[Seia]: I see… Mika thinks I still haven’t forgiven her.
[Seia]: She must see me as the biggest victim of her actions.
[Seia]: Oh, Mika. What a dummy.
[Seia]: She’s always been self-centered, impulsive, thoughtless, and she’s even self-destructive at times.
[Seia]: Mika would be the perfect cheeky, arrogant fairy tale princess.
[Seia]: But that wasn’t the role she got.
[Seia]: She was the villainess who tried to bully someone she didn’t like
[Seia]: And she eventually became entangled in a horror story of violence and murder instead.
[Seia]: But if any salvation still exists for her…
[Seia]: …it’s in the fact that I didn’t die, and her soul remains innocent of murder.
[Seia]: That tough smile she puts on is fueled by that one though.
[Seia]: For her, a lot is riding on my well-being.
[Seia]: Mika…
[Seia]: I wasn’t kind to her, yet she frets me this much.
[Seia]: This is long overdue.
[Seia]: We’re not grade schoolers anymore. I’m ashamed we’ve been so scared to speak openly with each other.
[Seia]: I’ll request Mika be brought here now.
[Seia]: I want to have a proper conversation with her…and tell her I’ll be attending the hearing.
[Seia]: The most grievous of her crimes is injuring me, so it would be very meaningful if I speak for her.
[Seia]: Ringing sound
[Tea Party Admin]: Y-You called, ma’am?
[Seia]: I’m sorry to bother you. Could you please bring Mika to me?
[Tea Party Admin]: M-Mika? I will request Nagisa’s approval to do so.
[Seia]: Thank you. Um… Please also inform Nagisa I would like to speak Mika privately, if possible.
[Tea Party Admin]: Yes ma’am!
[Tea Party Admin]: Tea Party Admin leaves
[Sensei]: “Meanwhile, I’ll go circle back with Nagisa.”
[Seia]: Thank you. It was nice speaking with you, Sensei.
[Seia]: I’m a bit tired, so I’ll lie down while I wait for Mika.
[Seia]: Apologies, Sensei. If you’ll excuse me.
[Sensei]: “I’ll see you at the hearing, Seia. Take care.”
[Seia]: You as well, Sensei.
[Seia]: Fade to black
[Seia]: (I informed Nagisa that both Mika and Seia would attend tomorrow’s hearing.)
[Seia]: (She was happy to hear the news and seemed a little less stressed. I decided to return to Schale early to prepare for tomorrow’s hearing.)
[???]: Let’s move on to the next agenda.
[???]: But of course!
[???]: I don’t disagree, but there’s something I want to confirm first.
[Seia]: (...)
[Seia]: (Oh… I fell asleep waiting for Mika.)
[Seia]: (I think the lucid dreaming has taken a toll on my health. And it’s been getting more difficult to wake up.)
[Seia]: (More importantly…where am I?)
[Black Suit]: Please speak, Maestro.
[Maestro]: …
[Seia]: (This is…! C-Could it really be?)
[Maestro]: I have an… inquiry for Beatrice.
[Beatrice]: Me? By my guest.
[Seia]: (This is…Gematria?!)
[Seia]: <<To be Continued>>
[Seia]: 05 - Inscrutable Seekers
[Seia]: Seia witnesses a group of Gematria members arguing in what she thinks is a dream. Among the Gematria members is Beatrice. She declares she will use the Arius Squad to eliminate Sensei, but senses Seia’s presence and quickly ends the meeting. Seia is greatly shocked and wakes up from the dream. Then, Mika comes to visit her.
[Black Suit]: …
[Beatrice]: …
[Maestro]: I graciously permitted you access to my art. To the very expression of my soul.
[Maestro]: To help you, I went so far as to bring forth the guardians of the commandments as Mimesises. I brought your crass plan to fruition.
[Beatrice]: And I’m so, very grateful for your assistance. Just behold the strength of my estate now.
[Maestro]: I don’t need your trite appreciation. Your current misappropriation of my work is a direct insult to me. And insulting me is not a wise move.
[Beatrice]: Oh! My sincerest, deepest apologies. I was unaware you personally devised the Mimesis phenomenon!
[Maestro]: You dare jest? Your insolence knows no bounds.
[Beatrice]: Hah! I’ve never been accused of insolence by an inferior.
[Golconde]: Hahaha! Shall we all try some breathing exercises together? Perhaps if you keep your voices down.
[Decalcomania]: But of course!
[Golconde]: What an entertaining conundrum! On one hand, our distinguished Maestro claims the Mimesis process belongs to he who harnessed it.
[Maestro]: …
[Golconde]: But then our dearest Madame asserts one cannot claim ownership just because one holds the leash! Fascinating, fascinating!
[Beatrice]: For once in your brainless existence, learn to keep your opinions to yourself, Golconde. You fabricate meaning behind what is nothing more than a temper tantrum.
[Maestro]: You defile my work and then dare to belittle me? You are creating weapons with no consideration for artistry! You have no understanding of metaphors! Of passion!
[Beatrice]: Please, your hysterics are unbecoming. There is no need for art when there is power. And your supposed art would never have seen the light of day without Black Suit and Golconde’s assistance.
[Beatrice]: Tell me, Maestro. Are you afraid? Do you fear the power I have amassed with your work? …Perhaps you fear we have no need for you any longer.
[Black Suit]: …
[Golconde]: …
[Beatrice]: Mark my words, speak to me of your little art project again and I will leave here with my estate. And you will be left with nothing but your passion.
[Black Suit]: Hahaha! What’s done is done, both of you.
[Black Suit]: Let’s not lose our heads over semantics. No offense, Golconde.
[Black Suit]: Beatrice, you’ve secured your own estate in Kivotos. This alone makes her invaluable to our plan, Maestro
[Golconde]: She’s subdued every single one of those angry little students in the Arius district! Hahaha! It’s a wonderful step forward for us all.
[Seia]: (...!)
[Golconde]: I mean, did we not see the disaster that was Black Suit’s Abydos… Oh, dear! Why, that was rather rude of me!
[Black Suit]: Haha! You’re only speaking the truth, Golconde. I’ll admit, I didn’t factor the teacher into my plans.
[Beatrice]: …Schale. That Sensei is a nuisance.
[Decalcomania]: But of course!
[Seia]: (...!)
[Black Suit]: A nuisance, yes. But an asset if they can be persuaded to our side.
[Maestro]: Ah, Sensei! Now there's one who understands art!
[Golconde]: What if we could turn them into one of us? Like we did with Beatrice! She could certainly use a friend.
[Beatrice]: All of you are foolish beyond comprehension. We must eliminate the Schale educator or all we have done will be for naught.
[Black Suit]: …
[Maestro]: …
[Golconde]: …
[Beatrice]: *sigh* Must I always be surrounded by incompetence?
[Beatrice]: Allow me to explain in terms you three can understand. It all begins with Misono Mika.
[Seia]: (...Mika?)
[Beatrice]: Mika is my muse, my inspiration. There’s a metaphor that’ll resonate with you.
[Beatrice]: It was thanks to her I came up with the idea of securing those ancient powers though the Eden Treaty. Without Mika, I would never have realized and subsequently dealt with the overwhelming threat of the prophetic archangel.
[Beatrice]: I must thank you and Decalcomania again, Golconde, for providing me such rare technology.
[Decalcomania]: But of course!
[Golconde]: Oh, please! I only had the recipe. Without our esteemed cook, there would have been no bomb.
[Golconde]: I actually felt a little bad about that! Hahaha! Didn’t our little masterpiece get you into trouble?
[Beatrice]: Almost. But thanks to Black Suit, I was able to plant a defense system in the body of an offering.
[Black Suit]: Always happy to help. The nameless priests’ technology proved more helpful than I expected.
[Beatrice]: Indeed, it did. And that brings me to the final inspiration that Misono Mika provided me: Sensei.
[Beatrice]: She invited them to Trinity, allowing me the opportunity to finally observe them with my own eyes.
[Beatrice]: This was when I came to see Sensei’s power. When I targeted Ariusm it was simply due to their isolation and anonymity. No one would find me there.
[Beatrice]: Trinity, Gehenna, Arius… It didn’t matter which one it was. I could care less for their little conflicts, all the festering hate between them.
[Beatrice]: What mattered was that hatred is a convenient means for control. The Eden Treaty was simply a way to gain new power. Squad, the rest of them, they were disposable at best.
[Beatrice]: But Sensei… They changed through my perfectly set scene spewing nonsense about saving the students and their dreams. And somehow, their methods worked.
[Beatrice]: I will not underestimate Schale and their teacher again. Their involvement alters the very purpose of our work.
[Black Suit]: …
[Beatrice]: Sensei must be eliminated.
[Golconde]: Beatrice is all fired up! She’s found herself a worthy opponent!
[Black Suit]: Hm… I can’t necessarily say I agree.
[Beatrice]: Will you stop me? We may have fallen in together under a common goal, but taking orders isn’t my strong suit.
[Black Suit]: …I’m well aware. Do as you wish, Beatrice.
[Maestro]: …
[Golconde]: …
[Black Suit]: What I’m much more curious about however, is what your plans are for the Arius district.
[Beatrice]: I’m preparing an altar.
[Black Suit]: Fascinating. To what end?
[Beatrice]: The same end you attempted to achieve in Abydos. I felt a ritual more…suited to my tastes.
[Black Suit]: Haha! You certainly aren’t the type to enter into a fair pact. But your methods fulfill the conditions all the same. Excellent work.
[Black Suit]: And you really believe Sensei is powerful enough to stand in your way?
[Beatrice]: Yes, which is why I’ve already taken measures to prevent that.
[Beatrice]: I’m sending Squad to eliminate Sensei.
[Beatrice]: Seia (...!!!)
[Golconde]: …
[Black Suit]: …Squad, hm?
[Beatrice]: I promised them forgiveness for Sensei’s head. Whether or not I actually do, that’ll depend on my mood.
[Seia]: Sensei is in danger! I have to warn someone!
[Seia]: (...Huh?!)
[Beatrice]: …An insignificant fly is eavesdropping.
[Black Suit]: …!
[Golconde]: One, two, three, four… I only count four!
[Beatrice]: That’s enough. We’re done here.
[Beatrice]: Beatrice leaves
[Black Suit]: …
[Maestro]: …
[Maestro]: The rest leave
[Seia]: *pant* *pant*

[Seia]: *cough* *cough cough*
[Seia]: Back to scene
[Seia]: (Everything feels so…foggy… Focus, Seia…!)
[Seia]: (The training of the Arius students, why the district was so elusive…and the foreign technology…the halo-shattering bomb…)
[Seia]: (It…It all ties back to Gematria… It all makes sense.)
[Seia]: (And Squad is after Sensei’s life.)
[Seia]: (Sensei’s in danger…! I have to tell someone!)
[Seia]: (They almost died during the Eden Treaty attack…)
[Seia]: (...And their bomb…there’s nothing more dangerous in all of Kivotos.)
[Seia]: (My life was threatened… The Eden Treaty broke down… Everyone got hurt… Sensei nearly died…)
[Seia]: Fade to black
[Seia]: (The starting point of all of this…it’s…)
[Mika]: Um… Hi, Seia…
[Seia]: Mika.
[Seia]: <<To be Continued>>
[Seia]: 06 - Broken Things
[Seia]: Shocked and afraid by what she’d heard, Seia screams at Mika and blames her for everything. Seia suddenly faints and is captured by Beatrice in a dream, but not before she sees Atsuko hanging from an altar. Meanwhile, Sensei encounters Saori in a back alley.
[Mika]: I-It’s me! I came as soon as you summoned!
[Mika]: I heard you wanted to talk alone, and I was so nervous!
[Mika]: I told my guard to wait outside the door. So, uh… What’s up?
[Seia]: Mika…
[Mika]: Oh no, are you okay, Seia? Your face is all pale, and are you shaking? I-I’ll call someone!
[Seia]: When you reached the Arius district, who did you meet outside of Squad?
[Mika]: What are you saying? Are you not feeling well, Seia?
[Seia]: Look at me and tell me again you’ve never been to the Arius district.
[Mika]: Seia… I…
[Seia]: Did you meet a tall woman with red skin? What else do you know about Squad?
[Mika]: …I don’t know what you’re talking about.
[Seia]: *cough* *cough*
[Seia]: Because you made contact with Arius…
[Seia]: !
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: I know. I’m so sorry I caused you all this…
[Seia]: No… Squad…is going after Sensei…
[Mika]: …?!
[Mika]: You must be mistaken, Seia…
[Seia]: This is all because you brought Sensei here!
[Mika]: …?!
[Seia]: No… I shouldn’t…blame you… I’m sorry.
[Seia]: *cough cough*
[Seia]: *cough* *cough cough*

[Seia]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: Yes, welcome to the Arius basilica.
[Seia]: …!
[Seia]: Beatrice fucking punches her
[Seia]: Ugh…!
[Beatrice]: Ah, yes. It makes sense it’s you. I knew some rat was peeping, but I didn’t think you’d follow me to this holy place.
[Beatrice]: Did you think you were safe in your dreams? The prophetic archangel…Yurizono Seia.
[Seia]: …Th-This place is… This is…the altar…
[Beatrice]: How observant of you. Not even my Gematria comrades know of this place. Be honored.
[Beatrice]: Beatrice gives an ugly ass smile
[Seia]: …!
[Mika]: Oh no! Seia! Please wake up!
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: Someone, Help! Come here! It’s Seia! Something’s wrong!
[Justice Task Force Member]: Seia?! I’ll summon help immediately!

[Mika]: Fade to black
[Seia]: Mika… I’ve hurt you again…
[Seia]: I’m sorry, Mika. It’s not your fault. None of it is.
[Seia]: …Sensei. Can you hear me? Please…
[Seia]: Run, Sensei. You have to get as far away as you can from the Arius district.
[Seia]: Otherwise, you’ll…
[Seia]: They’re coming…after you…
[Seia]: Sensei!
[Seia]: [Back Alley in Kivotos. Late at night.)
[Sensei]: (Did I hear Seia’s voice just now.) / (Am I imagining things? Something’s off.)
[Sensei]: (I came here after receiving a text from an unknown sender, but the street was empty and there wasn’t a soul in sight.)
[Sensei]: (Is someone behind me?)

[Saori]: …

[Saori]: <<To be Continued>>
[Saori]: 07 - Choices and Decisions
[Saori]: Seia’s condition worsens, and Mika is accused of hurting her. Meanwhile, Saori kneels in front of Sensei, begging for help to save Atsuko. Saori offers the halo-shattering bomb as collateral, but Sensei agrees to help and destroys the gift. Mika concludes that all her misfortune was because of Saori and escapes Trinity to seek revenge.
[Saori]: (Mika in scene)
[Voice]: H-How is she?!
[Voice]: She’s in a bad way. She keeps convulsing and throwing up blood.
[Voice]: Someone contact the Remedial Knights immediately! Or the Sisterhood! Just get someone here!
[Voice]: What about Nagisa?!
[Voice]: She’s received the news and is en route to the hospital! I’ve been contacting others too, but…
[Voice]: Have you gotten in contact with Schale?!
[Voice]: I can’t get a hold of them! It’s strange… C-Could something have happened to Sensei?!
[Voice]: Don’t think that way! Just keep trying?
[Voice]: Who’s responsible for this? It must be that witch!
[Voice]: Door bangs
[Voice]: Wait! Based on the testimony, Mika couldn’t have done anything!
[Voice]: No! This happened after she went in the room! She’s at fault!
[Voice]: Door bangs twice
[Voice]: Stope! There’s no point of this… Gah!
[Voice]: Murderer! You’re a murderer!
[Voice]: Door bangs twice

[Sensei]: “...?!” / “...”
[Saori]: …Sensei.
[Saori]: Hime… They took Atsuko.
[Saori]: And then they attacked us… I was separated in the fight… I don’t know what happened to them.
[Saori]: I’ve been running from Arius…for days on end…
[Saori]: I was utterly useless.
[Saori]: Please… Atsuko… Atsuko is going to die!
[Saori]: Tomorrow at sunrise, she’ll execute Atsuko!
[Saori]: I have no right to ask you to believe me… but I beg of you…
[Saori]: Atsuko was raised for the express purpose of this moment…
[Saori]: I don’t know the details, but it was her fate to die since she was born.
[Saori]: She said…
[Saori]: I could change Hime’s fate…if I just faithfully carried out her orders.
[Saori]: She said I could…save not only Hime…but others too.
[Saori]: She made me a promise. If I stole the Eden Treaty and granted Arius the power of the Saint Justina Council… If I could seize the Trinity and Gehenna districts…
[Saori]: Atsuko wouldn’t have to die.
[Saori]: In the end…
[Saori]: I failed.
[Saori]: I failed the Arius Squad.
[Saori]: We failed to steal the Eden Treaty.
[Saori]: We couldn’t conquer the Trinity and Gehenna districts.
[Saori]: We couldn’t save our colleagues.
[Saori]: I couldn’t protect Atsuko! Damn it!
[Saori]: I was useless. I failed.
[Saori]: There’s no one I can turn to for help. Trinity, Gehenna, and even Arius are out for my blood.
[Saori]: I don’t know who else to ask… [NAME] Sensei… No one else can save her.
[Saori]: Please…
[Saori]: I’ll do anything. I still have a bomb that destroys halos. I’m putting my life in your hands.
[Saori]: You can use this to kill me.
[Saori]: If you even so much as suspect me, you can kill me.
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Please…help Atsuko…
[Saori]: I beg of you…
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Voice]: Murderer! Bring out the murderer! It’s all her fault!
[Voice]: Black screen
[Seia]: Because you made contact with Arius…
[Seia]: Squad…went after Sensei…and…
[Seia]: This is all because you brought Sensei here!
[Mika]: It’s…my fault?
[Mika]: It’s all because of me…
[Mika]: Seia got hurt…because I’m a stupid person. Because I’ve done unforgivable things.
[Mika]: For a fleeting moment… I thought I could have a second chance…to make amends.
[Mika]: Even if it was for the hearing, I wanted to see everyone… Nagisa, Seia, and Sensei…
[Mika]: Why… Why is everything so messed up?
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: I was living a fool’s dream when I thought I could have a second chance.
[Mika]: Truly a fool… Arius…the Arius Squad…and Joumae Saori lied to me…and I got taken advantage of…
[Mika]: And, in the end, I hurt my precious people.
[Voice]: Drag the witch out!
[Mika]: …
[Voice]: Make the Justice Task Force go in there and get her!
[Mika]: I see. I understand now…
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: I didn’t see it until now. Huh.
[Mika]: …Joumae Saori of the Arius Squad.
[Mika]: It’s all her fault, isn’t it?
[Mika]: She lied to me and tried to kill Seia. She fired missiles at Nagisa and hurt Sensei.
[Mika]: Everything, everything, everything…was her machinations.
[Mika]: I understand it all perfectly, now. I know what I need to do.
[Mika]: I have to hold Joumae Saori accountable for what she’s done.
[Mika]: It’s only fair.
[Mika]: I want her to feel all of my pain.
[Mika]: I’ll take all that’s precious to her. Until she’s left with nothing.
[Mika]: Mika smiles

[Saori]: B-But…
[Sensei]: “My students never need to kneel in front of me.”
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: …
[Sensei]: “I have a question. Who is the ‘she’ you keep referring to?”
[Saori]: The representative of the Arius district and owner of the Arius Satellite School. We usually call her ‘she,’ but also ‘Madame.’
[Saori]: I’ve only seen her a few times…but she’s a tall adult with a red dress…
[Saori]: Her name is Beatrice. Hime was the one who interacted with her a lot.
[Sensei]: “What happened to Hiyori and Misaki?”
[Saori]: After she took Hime, we were attacked…and got separated. I haven’t been able to find them.
[Saori]: They’re probably still on the run.
[Sensei]: “Do you know where she took Atsuko?”
[Saori]: The Arius basilica…in the Arius district. There’s a secret holy place she’s prepared for this moment. Atsuko must be there.
[Sensei]: “What’s the significance of the basilica?”
[Saori]: I don’t know what it’s for. Just that it’s been prepared for Hime for a long time.
[Saori]: Hime always said that was where she would meet her end.
[Saori]: Beatrice said the ceremony would be at sunrise tomorrow.
[Saori]: Please, Time is running out for Hime.

[Saori]: Y-Yes…but… I didn’t expect you to…
[Saori]: Have you already forgotten? I shot you!
[Saori]: Why in the hell would you help someone who put a bullet through you?
[Sensei]: “For the same reason I’m gonna confiscate that bomb. To keep you safe.”
[Saori]: Oh… Um… Okay.
[Saori]: Saori gives the detonator
[Saori]: This is the detonator. If you press this…
[Sensei]: “No. I want you to take off the bong and give it to me.”
[Saori]: Y-You want me to remove the bomb? Your insurance?
[Saori]: I don’t know what your play is here…
[Sensei]: Take the bomb.
[Saori]: But don’t worry. It won’t explode without the detonator.
[Sensei]: “Thanks for the information.” / “I can’t let a student keep such a dangerous item.”
[Saori]: …?
[Sensei]: Break the detonator.
[Saori]: Wh-What…?!

[Saori]: Sensei and Saori start looking for the scattered members of the Arius Squad. They find Hiyori hiding in a slum, and Misaki standing on the railing of a bridge. They successfully convinces Misaki to go to the Arius District with everyone to rescue Atsuko.
[Arius Student A]: Huh…?! H-Hey!
[Arius Student A]: Saori fucking guns them down

[Hiyori]: I see… You saved me so you could capture and torture me yourself!
[Hiyori]: That’s why you arrived when you did! You’re gonna throw us into that underground prison! I was told that place is full of the screams of students who rebelled against Schale.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hiyori]: Waaah! I’m finished. I’m totally finished. If I knew my life would end so early, I would have tried to enjoy it more! I would’ve finished all the magazines I wanted to!
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: I’m not going to die? Why are you with Sensei then, Leader? What is happening? Oh…!
[Saori]: Hiyori…
[Hiyori]: Is Sensei threatening you, Leader? Oh no! Leader’s life is a long series of suffering, just like me! Look at the pain on her face! I’m so sorry for existing!
[Sensei]: “Hiyori, we’re just here to rescue you.”
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: Huh?! Me? Did you get the wrong person?
[Hiyori]: Did you get hit on the head? Do you not remember who you are? I might cry with relief if you’re actually rescuing me…but are you? I don’t know what’s happening…
[Saori]: They’re not lying, Hiyori. Sensei decided to help us.
[Hiyori]: …??
[Sensei]: “We’re going to save Atsuko before it’s too late.”
[Hiyori]: Hime… Atsuko…
[Hiyori]: Do…Do you really think we can save Hime from Madame?
[Hiyori]: Um…
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: She offered to let me go back to the Arius district if  I sold out Leader’s location.
[Saori]: …!
[Hiyori]: She said, seeing as I was just following orders, she would be lenient…
[Saori]: I see.
[Saori]: I think you should do it, Hiyori.
[Hiyori]: …H-Huh?
[Saori]: Tell her where I am, so she’ll let you return to the district. Keep yourself safe.
[Saori]: It won’t stop me from trying to save Atsuko. You’ve done enough.
[Hiyori]: Wh-What?! But I…
[Saori]: I’ve always understood this day would come. Thank you for meeting my demands all this time.
[Hiyori]: But… You see… I turned it down…
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: Wh-What is this change in mood? Why do you look like you’re relieved you could forgive a traitor! Am I a traitor to you?! Waaaah! This is the worst!
[Hiyori]: I mean… What if she was lying? And…we’ve been doing this together this whole time… I don’t want to go back without you…
[Hiyori]: And…what about Atsuko?
[Hiyori]: I can’t just leave Atsuko behind and retreat to safety.
[Hiyori]: You feel the same, don’t you, Leader? That’s why you came to get me.
[Saori]: Yeah. We have to save her, no matter what.
[Saori]: We’ll find Misaki and figure out a plan.
[Hiyori]: …Right. We need her… Let’s go!
[Hiyori]: I…I think I know where she might be.
[Saori]: I think I’m thinking of the same place…
[Sensei]: “Perfect. Then let’s go.”
[Hiyori]: O-Okay…!
[Hiyori]: [An Abandoned Bridge]
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: This place…
[Sensei]: “We’re pretty high.”
[Sensei]: Black screen
[Misaki]: Yes, and the river flowing below is at least five meters deep.
[Misaki]: Back to scene
[Misaki]: Because the current is fast, if you lose consciousness upon hitting the water, you’ll be swept away in the blink of an eye.
[Saori]: Misaki.
[Hiyori]: M-Misaki…!
[Misaki]: Leader, Hiyori…and even Sensei…
[Misaki]: Ah, I see. That’s the decision you made, Leader.
[Misaki]: I’m surprised you proposed it, and even more so that Sensei accepted.
[Misaki]: I’ll admit, I didn’t think this scenario was possible. I’d imagine neither of you did either.
[Misaki]: But did you hear, Sensei?
[Misaki]: I was offered a chance to return to Arius if I just killed you.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Misaki]: Hiyori and Leader likely received the same offer.
[Hiyori]: A-Along the same lines, more or less.
[Saori]: Yes, I did. Eliminate Sensei and earn her forgiveness.
[Misaki]: You trust your back to someone who wants to shoot it, Sensei?
[Misaki]: Not only that, but to someone who’s already shot you once?
[Saori]: …
[Sensei]: “Saori would’ve shot me by now if that was what she wanted.”
[Misaki]: I see.
[Misaki]: Regardless, the situation doesn’t change.
[Misaki]: Misaki steps back
[Sensei]: “Misaki? You’re a little too close to the railing for comfort…”
[Hiyori]: M-Misaki…?!
[Misaki]: This rescue mission is a lost cause.
[Misaki]: Infiltrate the Arius district, fight all their troops, and reach the basilica where Hime is being held?
[Misaki]: Not only is that impossible, she is in a position of technology I’m sure we couldn’t even dream of.
[Misaki]: Even with Sensei’s help, the three of us stand no chance.
[Misaki]: And if by some miracle we do rescue Atsuko, what then?
[Misaki]: It’s simply a stay of execution.
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: Hime’s life has nothing but pain. Why do you insist on prolonging it for her?
[Misaki]: Vanitas Vanitatum… That’s the only truth we can understand.
[Misaki]: Don’t you agree, Leader?
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Misaki steps back further
[Misaki]: No? Do you have an answer, Sensei?
[Sensei]: “Misaki, please just move away from the railing and we can talk.”
[Saori]: You can shut the hell up, Misaki.
[Misaki]: …
[Saori]: You think this pathetic display will finally bring you peace? End your suffering? You think I would humor this?
[Misaki]: …
[Saori]: Listen, Misaki. If you jump, here’s what I’m gonna do.
[Saori]: I’m gonna take off my coat and jump off the bridge after you. You know I’ll catch up to you.
[Saori]: I’m sure you put rocks in your coat, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll tear it off you and drag you out of the water.
[Saori]: That’ll take me about twenty seconds. If you’re unconscious, I’ll give you CPR until you wake up.
[Saori]: You can’t pull one over me like that, Misaki.
[Saori]: I’ve never let you get away with it before. What makes you think I’ll start now?
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: *shiver*
[Misaki]: It was worth a shot.
[Misaki]: Misaki steps back forward
[Misaki]: So. You really intend on rescuing Hime.
[Misaki]: I’ve followed you blindly until now. If our fates are predetermined, it doesn’t matter what I choose.
[Misaki]: Lead the way, Saori.
[Saori]: As usual, I leave my back to you.
[Hiyori]: Phew… Everything worked out…
[Misaki]: Leader, we only have ninety minutes left. If we don’t make it to the entrance by then, none of our planes will matter.
[Saori]: We have to move fast, Sensei. The clock is ticking.
[Saori]: I’ll explain as we go. Let’s leave.
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: Okay, th-then, this way!
[Sensei]: “Let’s save Atsuko.”
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 09 - To the Arius District 1
[Sensei]: To enter the Arius District, Sensei and the Arius Squad members head to an entrance in the underground catacombs in Trinity. However, Arius students stand in their way, under Beatrice’s orders.
[Sensei]: “Ninety minutes left until what?”
[Misaki]: We have to go through the underground catacombs to get to the Arius district.
[Misaki]: There have so far been about 300 entrances discovered in the catacombs. But only some of them are real entrances.
[Saori]: You’ll be lost in the catacombs until you starve if you choose the wrong entrance.
[Saori]: So we’ve been receiving and deciphering code for the internal route that leads from the real entrance to the catacomb to the Arius district.
[Misaki]: The insides of the catacombs shift periodically.
[Sensei]: “The tunnels themselves move?”
[Misaki]: More or less. Paths previously open will suddenly be blocked. It’s easy to lose your sense of direction.
[Misaki]: I don’t understand the mechanics behind the structure, but it’s essentially an ever-changing maze.
[Hiyori]: Seeing how the real entrance changes so much, we can’t find it without them telling us.
[Saori]: There’s no reason to show a runaway hound the way home.
[Hiyori]: B-But we’ve figured out one valid entrance. That’s our ticket in.
[Misaki]: It’ll change at midnight tonight, hence the 90 minutes.
[Saori]: If it chooses, we have no way of returning to Arius.
[Saori]: Even if we were to find away, it wouldn’t be in time to save Hime.
[Hiyori]: We gotta hurry…
[Hiyori]: Gunfire
[Hiyori]: ?!
[Arius Student A]: It’s Squad!
[Arius Student B]: I knew it! They’re here! Get ready for battle!
[Misaki]: …They must have been thinking the same thing.
[Saori]: Commencing assault.
[Hiyori]: Oh geez, life really is suffering.
[Misaki]: …Troublesome.
[Saori]: Show them how sharp our fangs are!
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: Misaki and Hiyori are pleasantly surprised at how much smoother combat is under Sensei’s command. Saori presses them to continue and they head to Trinity’s underground catacombs.
[Misaki]: It makes sense that you were so difficult as an enemy, but helpful as an ally.
[Hiyori]: I-Is this the power of an adult?! I don’t know if I should be scared or amazed!
[Misaki]: If we continue at this rate, we have a chance of making it.
[Saori]: Not if we keep stopping to chat. Let’s move.
[Misaki]: …To Arius.
[Hiyori]: Yes!
[Hiyori]: <<To be Continued>>
[Hiyori]: 10 - To the Arius District 2
[Hiyori]: Upon arriving at the entrance to Trinity’s underground catacombs, the Arius Squad members attempt to break through their enemies with brute force.
[Misaki]: We can enter the catacombs through here.
[Misaki]: Based on how the troops were able to find us, she already knows we’re using this passage.
[Saori]: Be on guard. She’ll stop at nothing.
[Misaki]: I know it was our only option, but we’re proceeding too predictably.
[Misaki]: It’s no surprise she found us so quickly.
[Hiyori]: A-Are we sure this is a good idea then?
[Misaki]: It’s our only idea.
[Saori]: We’re charging through.
[Misaki]: There was never any other option. And I think the unknown variable Sensei brings to the formula will make them tread carefully.
[Hiyori]: Heehee… I’m excited to work with Sensei.
[Sensei]: “I’ll do my best to live up to your expectations.”
[Saori]: There will be well-trained, elite soldiers waiting for us.
[Saori]: We’ll lead the way. Sensei, follow closely behind.
[Saori]: We must beat them here if we have any hope of saving Hime.
[Saori]: Let’s tear them apart!
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: (Mika appears during the battle and defeats the boss)
[Saori]: Just as they finish defeating the Arius students in their way, there’s an explosion and a new pursuer, Misono Mika, appears in front of the Arius Squad and Sensei.
[Saori]: Multiple Arius students fall as Mika shows herself
[Hiyori]: …?!
[Misaki]: …This is unexpected.
[Mika]: Really? I was totally expecting it! Hahaha. Surprise!
[Saori]: Misono Mika…
[Mika]: That’s my name! I guess you remember me huh? ☆ What’d you think of my entrance? I was going for cool, vengeful villainess.
[Mika]: Haven’t you missed me, old friend? Why the long face? You look…
[Mika]: …You look like you’re looking at a witch or something.
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 11 - Pursuers
[Mika]: Mika attacks the Arius Squad, and they’re quickly defeated. But Sensei finally arrives at the scene and convinces Mika to let them go. The Arius Squad forges on to the catacombs, and Mika battles with the Arius members standing in her way.
[Saori]: Misono Mika…
[Mika]: That’s my name! I guess you remember me huh? ☆ What’d you think of my entrance? I was going for cool, vengeful villainess.
[Mika]: Haven’t you missed me, old friend? Why the long face? You look…
[Mika]: …You look like you’re looking at a witch or something.
[Saori]: You did appear out of nowhere after apparently breaking out of prison.
[Mika]: Heehee. I guess I did. I just wanted to see my gals!
[Mika]: I mean, we do have a teensy bit of unfinished business to handle. Don’t we, Saori?
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: *whisper* Where is Sensei?
[Hiyori]: Sensei was following close behind… No more than a few minutes.
[Mika]: Are you wondering how I knew you were here? I was paying attention you know. Watching your methodologies again and again. Did you dismiss me that easily?
[Saori]: How long until the passage closes?
[Misaki]: About twenty-eight minutes. If we fight now, we both lose and don’t reach the entrance in time.
[Hiyori]: W-We’re gonna lose?!
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: We’ve been on the run for days. Everyone’s exhausted. Tactical advantages are what’s getting us through right now, not brute force.
[Misaki]: Sensei’s commands has gotten us through to this point.
[Misaki]: Misono Mika is the main muscle behind the Tea Party. A fight of raw strength is exactly what she wants.
[Mika]: You sure thought I was stupid, huh? But I figured you out in a snap.
[Mika]: I’m the one who started the coup, if you recall. I know all your key rendezvous points and meeting places. I totally forgive you for not knowing this, but I’m kind of a big deal.
[Mika]: But of course you didn’t know. You thought I was a fool you could lie to. Manipulate. Take advantage of.
[Misaki]: Our best option is to retreat and regroup.
[Saori]: No. We’ll lose our only opportunity to get to Arius.
[Misaki]: We could distract her until Sensei gets here.
[Saori]: That’s…
[Mika]: Hello? Are you seriously ignoring me?! That’s like, so rude. Don’t you remember the good old days of conspiracy and betrayal?
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: I’ll have to punish you bullies!
[Mika]: Mika dashes towards Squad
[Hiyori]: Sh-She’s already there!!!
[Saori]: Scatter! Don’t fight head-to-head!
[Saori]: Black screen accompanied with gunshots and explosions
[Sensei]: (Squad said they would handle the front, but I can’t reach them.) / (Did I just hear shooting sounds?)
[Sensei]: Gunshots with explosions
[Sensei]: Hurry and follow the sounds.
[Hiyori]: H-How is she so…strong…fast… Urgh!
[Hiyori]: Hiyori falls
[Saori]: Ugh.
[Saori]: Mika holding Misaki hostage
[Mika]: This is the infamous Arius Squad? This is it?
[Mika]: Hahaha! Were you always this bad? A dummy would put up a better fight. Aww, is it because you have lots of boo-boos? Hahahaha! Hilarious!
[Misaki]: Ugh…
[Mika]: Huh? Where’s the girl who never talks? With the weird mask? It’s okay, I’ll hunt her down after I’m done here.
[Saori]: …?!
[Mika]: What’s wrong Saori? I’m an open target! Shoot me! Did you run out of bullets?
[Mika]: Black screen with Mika tightening her grip
[Misaki]: Damn it…
[Misaki]: Back to scene
[Saori]: Misaki!
[Mika]: Oh, so now you guys are all buddy-buddy? I thought heartless Arius idiots only cared about their stupid missions.
[Mika]: I’m not a fan of you having friends at all, but relationships ARE important. You know what? I used to have someone I cared about like that! Seia? You remember trying to kill her?
[Mika]: *sigh* Don’t get me wrong, you have no idea how many times I’ve wanted to slap her right across the face. Seia really gets under my skin.
[Mika]: But you know, if she gets hurts, I get so anxious it’s the only thing I can think about.
[Mika]: So imagine when I heard Seia died! I went absolutely nutso crazy! Feelings can be so silly.
[Mika]: Even if I hated her and wanted to make her suffer sometimes, she was precious to me… I didn’t want her to die… I didn’t wanna be a murderer…
[Mika]: But none of that matters anymore.
[Mika]: Mika shoots Misaki
[Misaki]: ARGHHHH!
[Saori]: Misaki?!
[Mika]: I told you to teach her a lesson, not destroy her halo! Didn’t I?
[Mika]: Well, I guess you can’t say I’m completely faultless. I did kind of ruin everything.
[Mika]: But you see. I realized something.
[Mika]: Because of this…incident, I’ve lost everything.
[Mika]: The academy…my friends…my home… my memories…my promise with Sensei…
[Mika]: Go back to normal? Second chances? Hah! What a silly little fantasy I had. There’s no such thing as going back now.
[Mika]: I want you to suffer, Squad. Saori. I’ll make you feel my pain.
[Mika]: You’ll learn my loss. My suffering. My headache. It’s only fair.
[Mika]: Mika draws her weapon
[Saori]: …?!
[Sensei]: “Stop it, Mika!”
[Sensei]: ?!
[Sensei]: Mika lets go of Misaki
[Mika]: S-S-Sensei…?!
[Saori]: Sensei…
[Saori]: Black screen
[Sensei]: “Mika! What are you doing here?!”
[Mika]: I-I…um…so…
[Mika]: I don’t understand. Why?
[Mika]: Sensei. Why are you with Squad?
[Mika]: This wasn’t supposed to happen.
[Mika]: I didn’t think Sensei would be here. I didn’t want you to witness this.
[Mika]: Explosions accompanied with Arius students
[Arius Student A]: This way!
[Arius Student B]: Misono MIka is on scene! Fire at will!
[Arius Student B]: Black screen with Mika being shot
[Sensei]: “Mika…!”
[Misaki]: *cough* Arius is on our tail, Sensei. We have to leave her.
[Sensei]: “Mika! Go back to Trinity! I’ll explain everything! / “Wait at Trinity! I’ll be there! I promise!”
[Arius Student A]: That way! Squad sighting confirmed!
[Arius Student A]: Gunfire
[Hiyori]: Th-The passage is gonna close! H-Hurry!
[Sensei]: Go inside the catacombs with Squad.
[Saori]: Run!
[Saori]: Black screen with gunfire and running
[Hiyori]: *pant* *pant* W-We’re alive…
[Misaki]: Barely made it. We need to put more distance between us. Let’s go.
[Saori]: You’re right. Sensei, please stay close. The path is complicated from here.
[Hiyori]: And there’s no signal either…so if you get lost you’ll be lost forever and ever and ever.
[Saori]: I’m hoping to avoid that outcome. Arius is this way.
[Sensei]: “(Mika…)”
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: (Did she escape prison to take revenge on Squad?) / (Is everything okay back at Trinity?)
[Arius Student C]: They’ve escaped into the catacombs. Do we follow?
[Arius Student A]: We can still make it! Give chase!
[Arius Student A]: ?
[Mika]: Owwie, owwie, owwwwww!
[Arius Student A]: Misono Mika?
[Arius Student A]: Guns drawn
[Mika]: Oh, reinforcements?
[Arius Student A]: Misono Mika. YOu used to support our cause. Please leave this place immediately.
[Mika]: I’m sorry, I think I misheard. Do you think you can force me out? With this few?
[Mika]: Hahaha! Did you think you had the advantage because I’m alone? You really can’t fix stupid!
[Mika]: Where did Squad go? Where are you buying them time?
[Arius Student A]: No. We have been pursuing Squad since the Eden Treaty incident.
[Mika]: …Huh?
[Arius Student B]: Squad betrayed Arius and attempted to run away. We’ve been tasked with erasing them.
[Mika]: No way? Betrayed and ran away?
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Hahahaha! This gets funnier and funnier! They betrayed their own school? How come?
[Mika]: Ah, I see. Is this your big finale, Saori? I guess that’s what happens when a hunting dog loses its target. Huh.
[Mika]: I’m beginning to understand.
[Mika]: And Sensei… Hmm…
[Mika]: Sensei, you’re taking a risk to help someone in crisis again.
[Mika]: Oh, geez.
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: I’m beginning to understand.
[Arius Student A]: Stand down, Mika. This can be forgotten if you leave now.
[Arius Student B]: Report! The Schale teacher is accompanying Squad!
[Arius Student A]: What?! We must report this to her immediately.
[Arius Student A]: Both Arius students get shot and incapacitated
[Mika]: Have you been listening at all? Squad is MINE. Don’t touch my things.
[Mika]: Do you know what happens to people who go after things that don’t belong to them? I’ll teach you, as many times as you need.
[Mika]: ?!
[Arius Student C]: F-Fire! Fire now!
[Arius Student C]: Mika blocks bullets
[Arius Student C]: !
[Arius Student C]: Mika gives a scary face and charges the Arius students
[Arius Student C]: <<To be Continued>>
[Arius Student C]: 12 - Arius District
[Arius Student C]: Mika annihilates Arius’s pursing army and acquires information. Meanwhile, Saori faints from injuries, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Sensei gives her medicine, and they take a break so she can recover. But as they all drift into sleep, Seia suddenly appears in Sensei’s dream with a grave warning.
[Arius Student C]: …
[Arius Student C]: …So, at her order…Atsuko was taken to the Arius district’s basilica…
[Arius Student C]: That’s everything we know.
[Arius Student C]: Mika fucking punches her
[Mika]: You went to the Arius district…with Sensei…to save your friend?
[Mika]: Look at that. Huh.
[Mika]: Why is Sensei always on brand?
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: But…
[Mika]: Still… Still…
[Mika]: That won’t stop me from taking my revenge.
[Mika]: They’re all going to hate me, won’t they? Maybe even Sensei…
[Mika]: …But I can’t stop.
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: I just won’t.
[Mika]: I won’t forgive the Arius Squad for what they did to me. I don’t care what kind of monster I have to become to exact my revenge.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: …So don’t get in my way, Sensei.
[Mika]: Mika walks away
[Mika]: A door opens
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: …All clear! Come up!
[Sensei]: Go through the hole in the ceiling.
[Misaki]: I was right. It’s not guarded.
[Hiyori]: N-Not a soul in sight.
[Saori]: *pant* *pant*
[Sensei]: “Is this the Arius district?”
[Misaki]: Once upon a time. It’s now just an old, abandoned area.
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: The actual district is farther. We have to approach carefully. She’s waiting for us.
[Hiyori]: …This was a training ground once.
[Sensei]: “A training ground?”
[Misaki]: It was a historical site, actually. But it was converted to a training ground after the civil war ended.
[SenseI]: “There was a civil war?”
[Misaki]: Ten years ago, the Arius district was divided in two and war ensued. Any Arius student could tell you.
[Sensei]: Lean in to hear better.
[Misaki]: Did that pique your interest, Sensei?
[Misaki]: It’s not as exciting as you think. And has nothing to do with our current mission.
[Hiyori]: I…
[Hiyori]: I remember this place. I met Azusa for the first time here.
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: I think it was shooting training… Some kit was getting beat for disobeying orders.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hiyori]: No one said anything…just watched in fear. But she kept standing back up, no matter what the teacher did!
[Hiyori]: I remember crying because…b-because I thought her halo was gonna be destroyed.
[Hiyori]: Then Saori…I mean Leader came running up…
[Misaki]: We don’t have the luxury of reminiscing right now.
[Misaki]: …
[Misaki]: What’s the plan, Leader?
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: We may have Sensei on our side, but we can’t fight the entire school. How should we proceed?
[Misaki]: …
[Misaki]: …Leader?
[Misaki]: Saori falls
[Sensei]: “Saori?!”
[Hiyori]: Waaaah! L-L-Leader?!
[Saori]: *pant* *pant*
[Misaki]: Tsk. She has a fever. She’s been toughing it out this whole time.
[Hiyori]: This whole time? When could she have gotten sick?!
[Misaki]: I expect she’s been sick this whole time. She’s injured and has been on the run for four days straight. Her body is finally catching up.
[Hiyori]: C-Can we do anything to help her?
[Sensei]: Take out a fever reducer.
[Hiyori]: S-Sensei’s pocket is magical! There was medicine in it!
[Misaki]: You’re well-prepared.
[Sensei]: “I got it from a magical place called a convenience store.” / “I also have digestive medicine, cat treats, and a chocolate bar.”
[Hiyori]: I knew it… Adults are so…scary…
[Misaki]: What a relief.
[Misaki]: Here, Leader. This will help.
[Misaki]: Misaki gives the medicine
[Saori]: *gulp* *pant pant*
[Hiyori]: Leader is really suffering…
[Sensei]: “We’ll rest here for now.”
[Misaki]: …There’s no other choice.
[Hiyori]: D-Do you want me to keep watch?
[Misaki]: We’ll take shifts. You need rest too, Hiyori.
[Misaki]: I’ll go first. Sensei, you should rest as well.
[Sensei]: “Thanks, Misaki. Wake me if anything happens.”
[Hiyori]: Y-You’re the best Misaki.
[Hiyori]: Fade to black
[Hiyori]: I sat in a corner and fell asleep quickly…
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: Fade to white
[Seia]: SenseI? Finally! Can you hear me?
[Seia]: If you can hear my voice, please…
[Seia]: I’m trapped in an in-between. Neither dream nor reality. I don’t know when I’ll be able to escape.
[Seia]: I don’t have much time, listen closely.
[Seia]: I…made a mistake…
[Seia]: I found Gematria in a dream and eavesdropped on their meeting.
[Seia]: Pan to all the members of Gematria
[Seia]: Beatrice, who’s ruling the Arius district, was trying to hole some kind of ritual in the Arius basilica….
[Seia]: The end…Kivotos’ end will come with the conclusion of the ceremony.
[Seia]: Fade to white
[Seia]: I don’t know exactly what she’s doing, but it’s clear the end result will be our demise.
[Seia]: She seems to be trying to summon some kind of being into Kivotos. I’m not sure.
[Seia]: But I was overpowered by Beatrice in a lucid dream and encountered some sort of being from beyond my own consciousness…
[Seia]: The exposer was too much, and my body began breaking down.
[Seia]: Fade to white
[Seia]: And I… I hurt Mika.
[Seia]: I was so frightened, having confirmed that my visions were indeed Kivotos’ future. I lashed out at her, blamed her. And then she had to watch as my body began to fail.
[Seia]: Every route I take… I always hurt her.
[Seia]: Fade to white
[Seia]: Mika will blame herself and do something she’ll regret. I know her.
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: If Beatrice is successful, she will bring about the downfall of Kivotos.
[Seia]: And Atsuko of the Arius Squad will be sacrificed for the ritual.
[Seia]: Trapped in this in-between, there is nothing I can do. All I can do is hope you hear my pleas.
[Seia]: And Sensei… Please be careful. Beatrice wants you dead.
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Sensei, you must understand you alone cannot solve all of this.
[Seia]: You’ve done so much for each of us. Now, allow us to shoulder some of the burden.
[Seia]: I’m going to get out of here somehow, alert Nagisa and the others, and get Mika back.
[Seia]: It’ll be my turn to apologize.
[Seia]: So, Sensei…
[Seia]: Sensei… If you can hear my voice…please…
[Seia]: Run, Sensei. You have to get as far away as you can from the Arius district.
[Seia]: Otherwise, you’ll…
[Seia]: Fade to black

[Seia]: While Saori is asleep, Misaki and Hiyori tell Sensei about Squad’s past. Finally, Saori wakes up, and despite her heavy injuries, she decides to continue on to the Arius basilica to rescue Atsuko.
[Sensei]: “(Seia…)” / “(Mika…)”
[Hiyori]: S-Sensei?
[Misaki]: Sorry to wake you.
[Misaki]: Did you have a bad dream? We’re used to it, but it’s not easy to sleep in an environment like this.
[Sensei]: “...Something like a dream. How’s the situation?”
[Hiyori]: I-I’ve been keeping a close you on Leader’s condition. Her fever’s gone down, but she’s still resting…
[Misaki]: We can’t dawdle much longer. It’s still quiet, but we should leave in the next thirty minutes.
[Sensei]: “Thirty minutes…”
[Misaki]: Yes. Is something wrong?
[Sensei]: “Can you tell me the rest of your story?” / “I want to hear about your story.”
[Hiyori]: Huh? Th-That’s…
[Misaki]: Why so much interest? We were Schale’s enemy. It’s not a pleasant story.
[Misaki]: …Fine, I guess. We have time anyways.
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: My first memory is Madame declaring that the civil war was finally over.
[Misaki]: We were too young to understand. We didn’t know what a civil war or even who Madame was.
[Misaki]: She declared herself the new Student Council president, as well as owner and ruler of Arius. She wasted no time imparting her teachings on the Arius Academy.
[Misaki]: Fade to black
[Misaki]: All is in vain. Life is ultimately empty.
[Misaki]: Her philosophies…combat skills…anger and hatred… She taught us all of it to mold us into a perfect army.
[Hiyori]: She also taught us that the source of our suffering was Trinity…that Gehenna would never deign to coexist with us.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Misaki]: Madame drilled the hate into us, teaching us what it was to kill. Turning us into murderers.
[Hiyori]: And she made us believe murderers like us would never be accepted at another school.
[Hiyori]: She was our master. She told us she was a grown-up who taught the truth of the world. That we must follow and respect her.
[Hiyori]: She was an adult. We didn’t know anything but to accept her teachings.
[Hiyori]: Anyone who rebelled was punished ruthlessly, like Azusa and Hime.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hiyori]: S-Sensei?! Why do you look so scary? Did we do something wrong?
[Misaki]: I never promised a pleasant story.
[Hiyori]: Y-Your story made Sensei mad, Misaki…
[Sensei]: “I’m sorry. I was wondering why you call Atsuko ‘Hime’.” / “I’m sorry. Why do you call Atsuko ‘Hime’ sometimes?”
[Hiyori]: Wh-Why we call her Hime?
[Hiyori]: Well… Um… B-Because she’s Hime, I guess?
[Misaki]: Hime…has always been Hime to us.
[Misaki]: A direct descendant of the previous Arius Student Council president… So, kind of like a princess.
[Misaki]: The presidency was once passed down through families, so she would have been Student Council president of the Arius Satellite School.
[Misaki]: On the other hand, Leader, Hiyori, and I were petty thieves living in the slums since childhood. Although it was always Leader dragging us around.
[Hiyori]: I can remember Hime’s pretty dress… She look so graceful compared to us.. Heehee.
[Hiyori]: Leader and I always admired her… Misaki didn’t seem to care either way though.
[Misaki]: …It wasn’t that exactly. I just saw no reason to express it.
[Hiyori]: R-Really? All this time?!
[Misaki]: Hime is kind, before all else. She held out her hand to a gloomy child like me.
[Misaki]: When she took off her mask, her smile warmed me. Atsuko is…precious to me, too.
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: When the civil war ended, I learned that madame planned on sacrificing Hime.
[Misaki]: We didn’t really understand. We only knew how to blindly accept what was handed to us.
[Misaki]: It seemed natural the person we admired the most would be given such an honor.
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: But Leader… Leader didn’t accept it. She stole Hime away and brought her back to us.
[Misaki]: I didn’t even know something like that could be done.
[Misaki]: I think Leader must have made a deal with her. Madame would never have handed Hime over.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Saori]: I could change Hime’s fate…if I just faithfully carried out her orders.
[Saori]: She said I could…save not only Hime…but the others too.
[Misaki]: So Hime hid her face and voice and started to undergo rigours training with us.
[Misaki]: Leader taught all of us: me, Hiyori, Hime, and Azusa, who joined us later. Looking back, those were hard times.
[Hiyori]: I still have nightmares about it… Leader was almost as scary as the adults.
[Misaki]: Then, we were named Squad and utilized to carry out many missions for Arius.
[Misaki]: But we couldn’t complete this final mission, and Hime was taken.
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: We become traitors, joined forces with Sensei, who was our target in the first place, and then returned to Arius. It’s a ludicrous situation.
[Saori]: I enjoyed your story.
[Hiyori]: L-Leader?!
[Misaki]: …You’re up. Can you keep going?
[Saori]: I can. I’m sorry to have inconvenienced all of you.
[Hiyori]: I-I’m so relieved…! I might cry… I didn’t know what to do…!
[Misaki]: At least your fever’s gone down.
[Misaki]: Remember you’re not fully recovered. Don’t get frustrated you’re not at 100%.
[Misaki]: So, what’s the plan, Leader?
[Hiyori]: Go save Hime…?
[Saori]: No matter what.
[Saori]: Our goal remains the same. We’ll go to the Arius basilica and rescue Hime.
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: How will we infiltrate the basilica? She knows we’re here.
[Saori]: I’ve considered that. So, we’re going through the Arius Satellite School’s former institute.
[Saori]: !!
[Hiyori]: F-Former institute? It’s in ruins! It’s been falling apart for decades now!
[Misaki]: Why there?
[Saori]: Hime once told me that when the Council built the original Arius Academy building, they made an underground corridor between the basilica and the academy.
[Sensei]: “The Council built the Arius Academy?!”
[Misaki]: Ah. Do you not know? It was the Saint Justina Council who supported Arius’s exit from the Trinity alliance.
[Misaki]: Those who denounced Arius most strongly spearheaded our exodus and reconstruction.
[Saori]: The corridor is ancient history, so I doubt if she even knows of it.
[Saori]: We’ll slip into the basilica unnoticed if all goes well.
[Misaki]: Have you been there? Are you sure?
[Saori]: I’ve only heard of it from Hime. We’ll have to find it somehow.
[Misaki]: I don’t like so many uncertainties in a plan.
[Hiyori]: B-But what other choice do we have? There’s too many students to try to bulldoze our way through.
[Misaki]: Right. I wouldn’t normally agree to this, but we have Sensei as backup if things take a turn for the worse.
[Sensei]: “It’s our best option. Let’s do it.”
[Hiyori]: Oh geez, life really is suffering.
[Saori]: The former institute isn’t far from here, but don’t blow our cover. Or we’ll miss our chance to save Hime.
[Misaki]: Affirmative.
[Hiyori]: Let’s go, Squad!
[Hiyori]: Fade to black
[Hiyori]: [Somewhere in the Arius District]
[Mika]: *cough* *cough*
[Mika]: Ugh… I’ve been cooped up eating cake rolls for too long. I’m already tired.
[Mika]: At least I got to the Arius district. Step one, complete!
[Mika]: !!
[Arius Student A]: Wh-Who goes there?
[Arius Student B]: Aren’t you Misono Mika?
[Mika]: I’m like a celebrity! Hi, great timing!
[Mika]: Which way to the basilica please? You can just point me in the right direction.
[Arius Student B]: I-Intruder! I’ll contact the main force!
[Arius Student B]: Mika fucking kills her
[Mika]: How rude of you! If you yell like that in the middle of the night, you might disturb someone’s beauty sleep!
[Arius Student A]: F-Fire! Attack!
[Arius Student A]: Mika gets shot at
[Mika]: It hurts…
[Mika]: Darn. I know it was gonna come to this.
[Mika]: Mika fucking kills her too
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 14 - Meeting
[Mika]: In a corridor of the Former Institute Sensei’s communications are intercepted by Beatrice. Beatrice tries to convince Sensei that her actions in the Arius District, along with Atsuko’s sacrifice, were all to create a better world for adults and asks them to join her. Sensei rejects Beatrice’s offer, and a battle between the Arius Squad and the Saint Justina Council ensues.
[Mika]: …
[Misaki]: All clear. Move up.
[Hiyori]: Oh geez, life really is suffering.
[Saori]: Does it feel a little too quiet to anyone else? I’ve never seen it so abandoned.
[Hiyori]: There’re a number of unfamiliar things about this street.
[Misaki]: I’ve felt off since we arrived.
[Misaki]: We may have been gone for a long time, but everything feels different.
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: Like, has this area always had all this crazy stuff?
[Hiyori]: Cruise missiles installed everywhere, weapons for distribution everywhere you look.
[Hiyori]: Come to think of it, don’t you think the Mimesises are really weird? We just accepted them without question.
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: Fade to black
[Azusa]: How long has Arius had that cruise missile?
[Azusa]: When did you gain control of those mysterious soldiers?
[Azusa]: Even a bomb capable of shattering halos…
[Azusa]: How is any of this possible?
[Azusa]: Fade to black
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: Enemy approaching. Hide.
[Misaki]: Squad hides while Mimesises appear
[Saori]: Isn’t that..?
[Hiyori]: Th-The Council?! Is it the Saint Justina Council? Why’re they so scary looking?
[Saori]: How can they be here? Sensei canceled our contract.
[Misaki]: If you think about it…
[Misaki]: The objective during the Eden Treaty plot was to secure the Mimesis ability.
[Hiyori]: Hime did as the wooden doll in the cathedral told her to, just as she was instructed.
[Misaki]: With the Council troops secured, our mission was to occupy the Trinity and Gehenna districts.
[Misaki]: But we lost to Schale.
[Saori]: Yes… We failed both securing the Mimesis ability and occupying the academies.
[Saori]: But…she’d already secured the Mimesis ability…?
[???]: GRAAAAAAAH.
[Hiyori]: Wh-What was that…?
[Misaki]: It’s the scream of Ambrosius, a tactical weapon utilized during the Eden Treaty, It seemed to be some form of a Mimesis.
[Saori]: So, that means…
[Misaki]: Yes. Perhaps she only needed one successful Mimesis.
[Misaki]: Our real mission was to take Hime to the old cathedral and activate the Mimesis.
[Misaki]: The Gehenna and Trinity occupation…it must have been a distraction.
[Saori]: It had…nothing to do with saving Hime?
[Hiyori]: …
[Saori]: Then was the meaning of all this? All this pain…
[Saori]: Black screen
[???]: Whatever COULD it mean, little one?
[???]: Back to scene
[???]: Justina troops surround Squad
[Hiyori]: …We’re surrounded?!
[Saori]: How did you…
[Misaki]: She knew this was our only way in.
[Beatrice]: A+ for you, little Misaki.
[Saori]: …Madame.
[Beatrice]: This is my territory. You can’t so much as take a breath here without me knowing.
[Beatrice]: Your childish plans were obvious from the start. Did you really think you could outsmart me, children?
[Hiyori]: Sh-She read us like a m-magazine!
[Misaki]: Indeed. We’ve just been playing into her game.
[Saori]: …
[Beatrice]: And yes, Saori. You were correct.
[Beatrice]: From the beginning, your true mission was to bring royal blood to the old cathedral and manifest the Council.
[Beatrice]: All I needed was for you to open a path to the Mimesis ability. Of course, Maestro doesn’t like me treading on his supposed area of expertise much.
[Saori]: …
[Beatrice]: Trinity and Gehenna were little flies that landed on my chess board.
[Beatrice]: I only used them as an excuse to fuel the deep-seated hate within your district. It made you little fools…so very, very easy to control.
[Saori]: …?!
[Beatrice]: In that sense, I supposed you actually did fulfill your mission! I couldn’t have gotten the Mimesis ability without you.
[Beatrice]: Not only that, you handed over the royal blood so nicely. What an obedient little child you are, Saori.
[Saori]: I was only obedient to keep Hime safe! You lied to us.
[Beatrice]: Yes, yes. So tragic, so sad. Anyways, I have more important matters to attend to.
[Beatrice]: Gunfire and the scene turning black
[Saori]: U-Ugh!
[Saori]: Next scene
[Beatrice]: And we finally meet, [NAME] Sensei.
[Sensei]: “How do you know who I am?”
[Beatrice]: Schale’s educator. The beloved Sensei. Your reputation precedes you. I’ve anticipated this meeting for some time now.
[Beatrice]: Allow me to introduce myself. I am Beatrice, a member of Gematria, but you may call me Madame.
[Sensei]: “I can’t say I’m pleased to meet you, Beatrice. You’re the…ruler of Arius?”
[Beatrice]: Tch. Insolence. Yes, I was the only one in Gematria who successfully established an estate. And look at how mine flourishes.
[Beatrice]: Aren’t you curious how I’ve brought the entire student body under my control? I’ll tell you my secrets, for a few in return of course.
[Sensei]: “I don’t care about your twisted methodologies.” / “I already know how your type works.”
[Beatrice]: Oh? You’re just as I imagined you’d be.
[Beatrice]: You see, despite the way I look, I have no special powers or abilities.
[Beatrice]: I have at times wished for it…mind control, brainwashing. It certainly could have saved me a considerable amount of time. But us adults do things our way, as you well know.
[Beatrice]: Hate, contempt, anger, disgust… Such intense, all-encompassing emotions. They’re laughably easy to manipulate.
[Beatrice]: I do love the elegance of it. All I had to do was ignite the flame and watch my carefully laid-out plans burn the world down. At least, they would have before you intervened.
[Beatrice]: But those silly little brats you’re trying so hard to save were already waging a civil war before I came along. Did you know that, Sensei?
[Beatrice]: All that deep-seated rage…that boiling hatred against the world. I simply…utilized it. I would hardly consider them poor, innocent little students.
[Beatrice]: Of course all those students you fervently protect are the same. Human nature is violent and selfish at its core.
[Beatrice]: You need only turn your gaze at Trinity to understand. You’ve witnessed it, Sensei. Their hatred. Their cruelty.
[Beatrice]: When you consider it that way, isn’t there a beauty to my methods?
[Beatrice]: All I do is reach my hand into the insatiable void of ate they already possess and rip it open further. And then I fill the hole with my own teachings until my voice is the only command they follow.
[Beatrice]: And forcing them to commit heinous crimes under my command… The guilt they inherently suffer makes them latch to me even harder. Is it my fault? Is it theirs? I do love watching them unravel.
[Beatrice]: You see, I distort the very fabric of their reality. Their emotions are no longer their own, their relationships with each other falling to the wayside as I become the only lifeboat in the middle of the treacherous sea.
[Beatrice]: Paradise is only paradise if it’s exclusive. And in mine, adults dominate, exploit, and devour these unfortunate souls.
[Beatrice]: The more hellish for them, the more comfortable this paradise becomes for me.
[Beatrice]: Now, my dearest Sensei. Why don’t you run along and let me prey upon my loyal subjects in peace?
[Beatrice]: Forget about the royal blood.
[Beatrice]: I’ve spent so much effort on her. You wouldn’t want me to waste it, would you? And I promise, you’ll benefit from her sacrifice, too.
[Beatrice]: Aren’t you the least bit curious? What the sacrifice of one insignificant student can achieve?
[Beatrice]: I’ll make a world built just for you. Don’t you like the sound of that, Sensei?
[Beatrice]: Come join me, and I’ll tell you everything. About our new world, and secrets about the world we currently live in.
[Beatrice]: Kivotos is…truly…a marvel. A sublime tale of mystery and horror.
[Beatrice]: And I can show you the truth behind all of it. Take my hand, Sensei. It’s the last time you’ll see it extended.
[Sensei]: “Enough out of you.”
[Beatrice]: Oh?
[Sensei]: “I’m not interested in your delusional, twisted dreams.” / “I don’t need a truth that demands innocent blood.”
[Beatrice]: Hahaha. They were right. You are resolute in your ways.
[Beatrice]: If our truths can’t align, I can only see you as my adversary.
[Beatrice]: So…is this Eden Treaty your paradise? A bumbling, idealistic world where love and friendship overcomes all?
[Beatrice]: You’re really no better than those naive children.
[Beatrice]: You can’t slap the word paradise onto something and sell it to them. As an adult, you should be teaching the truth.
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: “Paradise is the origin of the first sin…”
[Beatrice]: Real paradise is hate. It’s anger and remorse. It’s the evil that lies within all of us
[Sensei]: “Beatrice.”
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Sensei]: !!
[Sensei]: “You’ve insulted our way of living long enough.” / “Your methods are an insult to everything I stand for.” / “We as adults should be protecting our students.”
[Beatrice]: …So that’s the path you choose, Sensei?
[Beatrice]: So be it. I’ll be waiting for you in the basilica.
[Beatrice]: Why don’t we take bets on whether you can make it to me?
[Beatrice]: Sensei, you truly are an incomprehensible presence.
[Beatrice]: Black Suit perceives you as a rival. Quite a compliment, coming from him.
[Beatrice]: Maestro is absolutely fascinated with you. He thinks you alone can understand him.
[Beatrice]: To Golconde, you’re a metaphor that completes his eternal search.
[Beatrice]: And I perceive you as an adversary. We reject each other, like oil and water.
[Beatrice]: My natural enemy.
[Beatrice]: More Justina approach
[Saori]: (...)
[Misaki]: (...)
[Hiyori]: (Yes, yes, yes. W-We’re…ready!)
[Beatrice]: Squash them. Grind them under your heel.
[Sensei]: “I’m with you, Squad!”
[Saori]: BEATRICE!
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: Mika suddenly appears, defeats the Council’s boss, and fights against the Arius Squad.
[Sensei]: “Mika…?!”
[Saori]: Mika?! How did you get here?
[Mika]: Long time no see, Saori.
[Mika]: I spent a long time thinking really hard about how I could get through Sensei to beat down Squad to pieces. But I’m really coming up short.
[Mika]: So, I just decided I’d figure it out as I go!
[Mika]: …Which wasn’t my best idea.
[Mika]: Sensei, you really are too strong.
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 15 - What Remains
[Mika]: Sensei tries to stop Mika, but she doesn’t listen, so Sensei and the Arius Squad try to subdue her.
[Sensei]: “MIka… You need to stop!” / “There isn’t time for this right now!”
[Mika]: Sorry, Sensei. I did try really hard to be good for a while.
[Mika]: I get what you’re doing, Sensei. But I can’t be the student you want me to be.
[Mika]: I’ve let you down so many times at this point, what’s one more?
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: Do we run or fight?
[Hiyori]: S-Sensei?
[Sensei]: “Mika needs to learn her lesson.” / “Let’s take Mika down.”
[Misaki]: …Good. I was getting angry.
[Mika]: Oh? Are you all going to punish me?
[Mika]: Really. The villains are always so misunderstood.
[Mika]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Mika]: The Arius Squad manages to suppress Mika, but Mika quickly escapes again after expressing her anger at all of them. The squad heads back to the basilica.
[Mika]: *cough* *cough*
[Saori]: *pant* *pant*
[Misaki]: We’ve subdued her. I think.
[Hiyori]: A-Are you sure she’s not gonna get up again?
[Mika]: Owwie… Sensei, you really do get in my way sometimes.
[Sensei]: “Mika… Seia will be fine. She’s doing her best” / “Mika, you need to go back. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
[Mika]: Sensei…
[Mika]: I did it again… Didn’t I…?
[Mika]: I keep betraying you… I’m just the worst student…taking advantage of your trust..
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: But… I…
[Mika]: I… I can’t…
[Mika]: I have nowhere to go, Sensei. Not Trinity, not anywhere.
[Mika]: I’m the witch of Trinity now. I hurt Seia over and over again…
[Mika]: I don’t wanna get kicked out… I won’t get to play with Nagi…or Sensei… All the people I treasure will be out of my reach!
[Mika]: And if I’m expelled… I won’t be Sensei’s student anymore. Sensei won’t care about me.
[Mika]: I know there’s no happy future written in my fate…
[Mika]: Because I’m a villain of everyone’s story! I’m…I’m a murderer.
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: The only thing I have left to live for is my revenge!
[Mika]: Squad! Why? Why are things like this?
[Mika]: You stole everything from me! I lost everything I held dear!
[Mika]: It’s all your fault!
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: …
[Mika]: Why do you guys get to see your friends every day? Enjoy your lives?
[Mika]: Meanwhile, I…
[Mika]: I’ve become a speck of dust..
[Mika]: There’s nothing left to live for…
[Mika]: So, tell me!
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: What am I supposed to do?
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Back to scene
[Mika]: I can’t let Saori get away with what she did…
[Mika]: I can’t stand that Sensei is helping this shameless, lying backstabber.
[Saori]: …
[Mika]: Sensei, I’m sorry. You can’t stop me.
[Mika]: Mika leaves
[Sensei]: “Mika! Come back!”
[Hiyori]: Wh-Where did she go?
[Misaki]: What is she thinking? She’s a loose cannon.
[Saori]: Mika really…hates me to her core.
[Saori]: I can’t blame her for thinking I’m shameless. But I’m doing what I must.
[Misaki]: Leader, what should we do? Mika isn’t going to give up. The odds aren’t stacked in our favor.
[Misaki]: Arius and the Council. An incredibly strong, vengeful Tea Party member.
[Saori]: It doesn’t matter what the odds are. We enter the basilica through the former institute, just as we planned.
[Saori]: There’s no time left. We have to throw caution to the wind.
[Saori]: Saori leaves
[Hiyori]: Oh geez, life really is suffering.
[Hiyori]: Hiyori leaves
[Misaki]: …*sigh*
[Misaki]: We’ll be left behind, Sensei.
[Misaki]: Misaki leaves
[Sensei]: Follow / “(Mika…)”
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 16 - Underground Corridor
[Sensei]: [Arius Satellite School Former Institute]
[Saori]: This way.
[Sensei]: “This is the oldest building I’ve seen in the Arius district.”
[Hiyori]: I’ve n-never been inside before…
[Misaki]: That makes sense. It may be in ruins, but it’s considered a historical site.
[Hiyori]: It’s so weird to think the original Arius students studied in there. I wonder what kind of lessons they had…
[Misaki]: Those questions are lost to history.
[Saori]: Let’s go. We need to get to the underground corridor.
[Saori]: [Former Institute Underground Corridor]
[Hiyori]: Th-This way! I think this is it!
[Saori]: Great job, Hiyori.
[Misaki]: A moment, please.
[Misaki]: ?
[Misaki]: If the passage is connected to the basilica in a straight line…the terrain will be dangerous.
[Saori]: I’ve thought about the possibility of an ambush. Considering it’s a straight line…
[Misaki]: No, I’m talking about Misono Mika.
[Misaki]: I’ve been trying to think what I would do in her shoes.
[Misaki]: Right now, Sensei is her only obstacle. She doesn’t want to hurt them, but Sensei’s presence puts realizing her vengeance out of reach.
[Misaki]: That means…
[Misaki]: *rumble*
[Misaki]: That’s not good.
[Hiyori]: S-S-Sensei! Oh no, turn around! That pillar’s collapsing!
[Hiyori]: Black screen
[Sensei]: “...!” / Dodge the falling pillar.
[Sensei]: *boom*
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Misaki]: Are you okay, Sensei?
[Sensei]: “Yeah, just barely.”
[Hiyori]: Th-Thank goodness. I know these ruins are old, but it collapsed outta nowhere.
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: W-Wait! Where’s Leader?
[Misaki]: Leader? Where are you?
[Saori]: I’m here. On the other side of the pillar.
[Misaki]: There’s too much smoke and debris. Are you hurt?
[Saori]: I made it out okay. Just on the wrong side.
[Hiyori]: I-I’ll move the pillar for you, Leader! Just wait one second!
[Hiyori]: Hiyori fucking moves the pillar
[Hiyori]: Augh! What do I do? Me moving it is just making everything worse! Why do I always make everything worse?
[Hiyori]: Black screen with explosion
[Misaki]: *cough* *cough*
[Misaki]: This is bad. There’s no way around it.
[Hiyori]: Everything is ruined! Leader! Are you okay?
[Misaki]: Leader, can you hear me? We’re going to have to find a point in the middle to meet.
[Misaki]: Back to scene
[Saori]: I think I’ll have to take a rain check on that.
[???]: …I did it! I really had to control the power so Sensei wouldn’t get sucked in!
[???]: Saori puts on her mask
[Saori]: …
[Mika]: Well, Joumae Saori. I was hoping it would be you.
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 17 - Contest
[Mika]: Mika and Saori face each other beyond the rubble, cut off from Sensei and the rest. Their long-fueled rivalry finally comes to a head. Watching this, Beatrice explains the mysterious power lurking outside of Kivotos to Seia. Meanwhile, Seia continues to search for a way out of her daydream.
[Sensei]: “Mika! Stop this!”
[Mika]: …Sorry, Sensei. I have to.
[Mika]: You get the situation right, Saori? We’re on a bit of a tight schedule, so let’s hurry this up.
[Saori]: ……
[Saori]: One hour left until sunrise…
[Mika]: I’d be more focused on the present, if I were you. You might be safe if Sensei gets over here…
[Mika]: Who knows how long it’ll take for them to get through the rubble? I’m not completely evil though. If you can hold out until then, you win.
[Mika]: As if that would happen.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: I don’t like that expression. Why do you seem happy? Have you finally lost it?
[Saori]: …I was just reminiscing.
[Saori]: ?
[Saori]: ……
[Saori]: Sensei!! Don’t come help me!!
[Mika]: …!
[Mika]: Scene change
[Misaki]: ……
[Hiyori]: …?!
[Saori]: I’ll be okay! Go to Atsuko!
[Saori]: There’s no time left. Please! Save Hime!
[Hiyori]: L-Leader…!
[Sensei]: “Saori…”
[Misaki]: She’s right. Let’s go.
[Misaki]: We don’t even know the way to the chapel.
[Misaki]: Even if we leave now, it will already be too late.
[Hiyori]: ……
[Misaki]: But Leader is injured. She won’t last long enough for us to save her.
[Hiyori]: S-So we shouldn’t leave…
[Misaki]: We have to make a choice. Save Hime, or save our leader.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Misaki]: I’m leaving the final call to you, Sensei.
[Misaki]: Mika means business…but Hime’s life is hanging by a thread.
[Misaki]: What are you going to do?
[Sensei]: “I…”
[Sensei]: “Let’s go.” / Do what needs to be done.
[Sensei]: Black screen with walking
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: I guess Sensei chose Atsuko, in the end.
[Mika]: Aren’t you happy? Isn’t that what you wanted?
[Saori]: …Was this what you wanted, Mika?
[Mika]: What I wanted?
[Mika]: What do I want again? Oh…to separate Squad from Sensei, but…
[Mika]: ……
[Mika]: I wasn’t particularly aiming for you, to clarify.
[Mika]: I wouldn’t have really cared who it was.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Actually, it would’ve been nice if it was Sensei with me…
[Mika]: That would be asking for too much, huh?
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: Don’t give me that look. I know I can be a dummy.
[Mika]: What did Seia always say? Oh yeah! That I’m impulsive and careless. What a meanie!
[Mika]: Okay, fine. Maybe I lied a little bit.
[Mika]: I wanted it to be you. The object of all my hate at my mercy.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: Sensei only rescues their students. Sensei will go to the ends of the world to secure their students’ happy ending.
[Mika]: But villains? Villains who’ve betrayed and lied and hurt people don’t get anything good.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: So, Saori. Here we are at the end. Don’t you want to say anything?
[Mika]: This is the climax! The scene where the witch executes the hound! Which I guess you’re probably not happy about, but you really don’t want to say anything?
[Mika]: You can beg if you want! Scream and cry about how unfair this is, about how you don’t understand why I’m doing this.
[Saori]: …I do understand.
[Saori]: ?!
[Saori]: Saori drops a grenade
[Mika]: What was that? A grenade? No, a smoke bomb? Hm…
[Mika]: Explosion
[Mika]: Owiee… I-It hurts…
[Saori]: It’s a weapon that’s been banned from production. I found it at the Arius training grounds.
[Mika]: Oh, I’m so sorry. ☆ I didn’t actually care. It doesn’t matter what weapons you have.
[Mika]: Explosion
[Mika]: Ugh…?!
[Saori]: …This isn’t our first fight. I know how to handle you.
[Saori]: Gunfire
[Saori]: Mika falls
[Mika]: …Ugh.
[Saori]: As I said, I understand your hatred, Mika.
[Saori]: If not for me, you would still have your Tea Party, your friends…the future you were meant to have.
[Saori]: I also understand that it’s my responsibility to bear that hatred.
[Mika]: …How disgustingly amusing.
[Mika]: So you chose guerrilla warfare? Considering this terrain, I guess that’s the best possible way.
[Mika]: Also, did you really bring a thermo-pressure grenade to a gun fight? I hope you didn’t think that would be enough to take ME down.
[Mika]: I can’t say I don’t like your pluck.
[Mika]: But that doesn’t mean I’ll take it easy on you. Try your hardest, but…what is it you people always say? It’ll be in vain.
[Mika]: Black screen
[Saori]: I’ve learned that, even if all is in vain, there’s still a reason to fight.
[Saori]: Back to scene
[Mika]: Yeesh… How stubborn.
[Mika]: Another explosion with gunfire
[Beatrice]: Ah, Mika. My muse. Does she know her role? How she has helped to forge my hell? And I, hers?
[Beatrice]: The hatred that courses through our bodies…it confirms our very existence.
[Beatrice]: It’s much easier to comprehend than some paradise we don’t know exists. Wouldn’t you agree, Seia?
[Beatrice]: ……
[Beatrice]: How charming. You still haven’t given up.
[Beatrice]: The little cracks in your dreams you’re trying to escape through are hard to find, aren’t they?
[Beatrice]: You’re trapped in my web with no way out. Are you scared, Seia? Afraid of the power outside of Kivotos you can’t tear your eyes away from?
[Beatrice]: Your very existence attracted it like a moth to a flame.
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: …That thing.
[Beatrice]: You ventured a step too far into powers you didn’t understand. And now it’s dominated you.
[Beatrice]: Back to scene
[Beatrice]: I wonder…what will happen to you. Not even I know.
[Beatrice]: We’re equally as ignorant of it as you are.
[Beatrice]: An ominous light that can’t be interpreted, understood, or communicated with. An incomprehensibly idea that, in human eyes, has no purpose.
[Beatrice]: Gematria’s greatest threat…
[Beatrice]: We call it “color.”
[Beatrice]: A shriek is heard
[Beatrice]: At last. We are approaching the climax.
[Beatrice]: Do you feel it too? Ah, that. Yes. My trump card I carefully developed just for Schale. For your Sensei.
[Beatrice]: The Saintess of the Council, Barbara.
[Beatrice]: If completed as expected…it’ll be even stronger than the artificial angel series.
[Beatrice]: Maestro will complain about his silly art, but…
[Beatrice]: …a weapon’s beauty lies in its function.
[Beatrice]: I can’t wait to see Maestro’s reaction… I do hope it vexes him.
[Beatrice]: Will Schale and Squad overcome my weapon and interrupt the ritual? Or will they fail their mission when they’ve barely begun?
[Beatrice]: I can’t wait to see it unfold. This fickle destiny.
[Beatrice]: And you, Seia, will bear it in silence. And then you will believe that hell exists.
[Beatrice]: Another shriek is heard
[Beatrice]: Fade to black
[Beatrice]: Fade to white
[Seia]: *pant* *pant*
[Seia]: Beatrice…is wrong… I will not give…up… I will try…and try…
[Seia]: I must escape…find the cracks to slip out…
[Seia]: I cannot be trapped in this nightmare forever…
[Seia]: I cannot…will not be defeated here… I still…must…
[Seia]: <<To be Continued>>
[Seia]: 18 - Another Us
[Seia]: After losing against Mika, Saori recalls her past with the squad. In the end, she collapses. Mika approaches Saori and points her gun at her but suddenly bursts into tears.
[Saori]: This way, Hiyori, Misaki. Let’s hide here.
[Hiyori]: H-Hey…
[Saori]: Be quiet. Lower your head.
[Hiyori]: Who’s the girl in the middle over there? Sh-She’s wearing a really pretty dress…
[Saori]: I don’t know… She must be super important.
[Misaki]: That’s Hime. She’s of royal blood.
[Hiyori]: Really?! She’s royalty?
[Hiyori]: Woah! A real princess! She lives a totally different life from people like us.
[Hiyori]: I bet she’s never stolen food…or had frostbite…or slept on a cold floor…
[Misaki]: A-Are you crying?!
[Hiyori]: In a world full of suffering…I didn’t know such a beautiful person could exist… It’s so heartwarming. *sob*
[Saori]: I don’t care how heartwarming it is! You’re gonna give us away!
[Hiyori]: Sorry, b-but… *sob*
[Misaki]: …Even if she’s royalty, her situation is likely even worse than ours now.
[Saori]: …?
[Misaki]: They’re escorting a captured hostage to the enemy. She’s a prisoner of war.
[Misaki]: She’ll probably be locked away and never see the light of day, left alone to slowly starve.
[Hiyori]: Oh… Oh, no…
[Saori]: Stop, Misaki. You’re scaring Hiyori.
[Misaki]: …Sorry. So, what do we do? Just go back?
[Saori]: Of course not. Crowds like these are the perfect hunting grounds. Steal everything you can get your hands on.
[Saori]: Got it? Let’s go.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Gunshots accompanied with a fall
[Saori]: Stop!
[Arius Officer]: Get out of the way, eighth squad leader.
[Saori]: You’re going to destroy her halo! Please!
[Hiyori]: Please… Please stop… *sob*
[Arius Officer]: This is what resistance will get you. Move, if you don’t want to suffer the same fate.
[Beaten Kid]: *cough* You haven’t…broken…me…
[Arius Officer]: The insolence!
[Saori]: W-Wait!
[Saori]: I-I’ll teach her!
[Arius Officer]: Teach…?
[Misaki]: …And here she goes again.
[Saori]: I-I’m good at teaching! Hiyori, Misaki, and Hime have all improved their grades since I started helping them.
[Saori]: I’ll make sure she stays in line! So, Please…!
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Slap
[Misaki]: …hurts.
[Saori]: Misaki, don’t do this again. Please.
[Misaki]: …Why not?
[Saori]: W-Why not…? B-Because…well…
[Misaki]: Why should we have to go on struggling?
[Misaki]: I’m cold, hungry, and sick. Every day is the same. Painful and unbearable.
[Misaki]: Why do you force this meaningless pain on us? Whaty can come from this?
[Saori]: B-But…
[Saori]: It’s because…
[Misaki]: …I knew it. You act like you know everything, but you’re no better than us. You know nothing!
[Misaki]: Black screen with footsteps
[Saori]: M-Misaki! No, wait!
[Saori]: Wait! I-I…
[Saori]: Scene change
[Saori]: P-Please forgive me… I was wrong… I’m sorry…
[Saori]: I’m sorry…sorry…so sorry… I’ll never…
[Saori]: I’ll never disobey an adult’s order…never ever… I’ll let go of all hope… I won’t rebel.
[Saori]: I will never pray for happiness… Never again… I’m sorry…
[Saori]: So, please…forgive…
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Have mercy…please…
[Saori]: Mercy…
[Saori]: Why do you continue to resist, Azusa?
[Saori]: A symbol of reconciliation? It was a fool’s dream. A lie. It’s not like you to believe in lies.
[Saori]: Real truth lies in your training, in the lessons we have learned here.
[Saori]: Let go of all hope. Don’t rebel. Don’t pray for happiness. Everything is in vain.
[Saori]: Azusa! Are you listening?!
[Saori]: Wh-What? What did you say?
[Saori]: Fade to white
[Saori]: Where are you going? Come back… Azusa!
[Saori]: Tell me…please! What did you say? Don’t…Don’t leave us.
[Saori]: Azusa…
[Saori]: Have you…found your answer?
[Saori]: Please…what do you know? I…
[Saori]: What should I do?
[Saori]: Azusa…
[Mika]: …Azusa?
[Saori]: A-Argh…!
[Saori]: U-Ugh…
[Saori]: Saori falls
[Mika]: You can’t move with those wounds, Saori.
[Saori]: …This is it, then.
[Saori]: I guess this ending was already written in stone.
[Saori]: Black screen
[Saori]: …It’s fine.
[Saori]: Back to scene
[Mika]: What, exactly, is fine?
[Saori]: My ending. I ran out of pages a long time ago.
[Saori]: I kept running forward, believing with all my heart I was doing what I had to do. But that didn’t make it right.
[Mika]: Azusa…
[Saori]: …?
[Mika]: You called out for Azusa. Why?
[Saori]: …You heard that?
[Mika]: Azusa of the Make-Up Work Club…a spy chosen to aide my coup.
[Mika]: If it weren’t for Sensei, she would’ve remained what she was supposed to be: a mindless chess piece.
[Saori]: Azusa… She…
[Saori]: She was never meant to be a spy.
[Mika]: What?
[Saori]: At first, she was…
[Saori]: She was a symbol of reconciliation.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: What are you saying?
[Saori]: Reconciliation for Trinity and Arius… That was your idea, Mika.
[Mika]: I mean, yeah. But I just made it up to trick Sensei…
[Saori]: No. You don’t remember? You said it when you first approached us.
[Saori]: Before Seia’s attack. Before the Eden Treaty, before the coup… Before the lies and schemes.
[Mika]: ……
[Saori]: When we first met, you only spoke of peace.
[Saori]: <<Flashback sequence>>
[Mika]: Hi there! Are you an Arius student? What’s your name?
[Mika]: It’s such a nice day out! I love the feel of the sun on my skin.
[Saori]: Get to the point, Trinity.
[Mika]: Woah, there. Not very into casual conversation, huh?
[Mika]: Okay, okay. I’d like for Trinity and Arius to reconcile.
[Saori]: …What?
[Mika]: I know. It’s super crazy, huh?
[Mika]: I’m guessing you guys still hate us.
[Mika]: And I’d also say that’s probably why you stay hidden in this isolated district, and refuse any outside help. All because of some feud from years and years ago.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: Don’t look at me like that. I know how much anger and hatred from that feud pours into the present day. No one’s gonna want to compromise.
[Mika]: I mean, Nagi and Seia are still super against it. And I get it.
[Mika]: But at the same time, I don’t really understand. Would it be so bad for us to try to be nice to each other? Little by little, we could chip away at that hatred.
[Mika]: I really think it’s possible. That’s why I came out here to meet you guys. To try, little by little.
[Saori]: …Do you expect me to trust you?
[Mika]: I really don’t. So, how about this?
[Mika]: What if you transfer an Arius student to Trinity without telling anyone?
[Mika]: I could make it happen with a snap of my fingers. Being in the Tea Party has its benefits.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: If an Arius student can assimilate into Trinity, we can prove that we’re not so different.
[Mika]: She’ll be like…a symbol of reconciliation! Aren’t I a genius?
[Mika]: …
[Saori]: You’re insane. Your plan is insanity.
[Mika]: I know, right? But if we pull it off, Seia and Nagi would finally listen!
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: This isn’t a decision I can make. We’ll talk again later.
[Mika]: W-Wait! Does that mean you’re considering it? Do you have someone in mind?
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Saori leaves
[Saori]: ?
[Saori]: Azusa. It’s a mission.
[Azusa]: …A mission?
[Beatrice]: Reconciliation? Your naivety astounds me. You’re walking into a trap with your eyes wide open.
[Beatrice]: Although…this could work to our advantage. Observe her. See if she’s truly an artless child or a sly snake.
[Beatrice]: Reject it for now, but maintain the relationship. Milk her for as much information as you can.
[Saori]: You don’t want to…try?
[Beatrice]: Silly child. A symbol of reconciliation? If I scoffed any harder, I’d be able to spit on the Trinity girl.
[Saori]: ……
[Beatrice]: I sense discontent, Saori. You couldn’t possibly have been thinking of acquiescing to Trinity, have you?
[Saori]: …Of course not, Madame.
[Beatrice]: Tell me. Who taught you what it means to go hungry? Who stole the very roof from over your head?
[Saori]: …Trinity.
[Beatrice]: Good girl. There is no reconciliation. They have taken everything from you, except your hatred. Do not lose it.
[Saori]: Yes, Madame. I will not.
[Saori]: I don’t know what it was about her…but I thought Azusa…
[Saori]: I thought she could be that symbol for the academies.
[Mika]: ……
[Saori]: But we’ll never know what could’ve become of that future.
[Saori]: <<Flashback sequence>>
[Mika]: Seia’s just through there.
[Mika]: You’ll send her on a little extended vacation to the hospital, and I’ll be next in line to become host!
[Mika]: What fun! Aren’t you excited?
[Mika]: <<End flashback>>
[Mika]: …
[Saori]: Madame wanted Seia gone, and the opportunity presented itself.
[Saori]: You only thought of us as disposable foot soldiers, didn’t you? Why else would you have revealed Seia’s location?
[Saori]: But we weren’t some petty thieves you could manipulate.
[Saori]: We’re murderers. Day in and day out, we trained to destroy halos.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: And then we received a mission… Shatter Seia’s halo.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: And Azusa…she was assigned to the mission because she’d already studied and prepared to be our symbol of reconciliation.
[Mika]: …Nagi’s planning something weird.
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: A peace agreement with Gehenna? She’s gone totally crazy since Seia died.
[Mika]: Considering the situation, we should revisit our plan.
[Mika]: Plant a spy in Trinity, more carefully than last time.
[Mika]: <<End of flashback>>
[Saori]: You…
[Saori]: I didn’t understand what you wanted or what principles you upheld. I still don't.
[Saori]: I could've just brushed you off as a foolish, naive girl. But I know you better than that.
[Saori]: I thought your dreams of reconciliation were inconceivable, but…
[Saori]: But what if it wasn’t? What if we could emerge from the shadows?
[Saori]: Even now, I can’t erase the thoughts from my head.
[Mika]: ……
[Saori]: Mika…
[Saori]: When you first approached me, you really did want to reconcile, didn’t you?
[Mika]: ……
[Saori]: You came to us with the best interests, but I deceived you and dragged you into hell.
[Saori]: You couldn’t accept it…the hell that erupted from your hopeful dreams. So, you locked away your memories and embraced the darkness you believed lived inside you.
[Saori]: And you’re not the only one.
[Saori]: Hiyori and Misaki were dragged into Squad, and Hime…she never should have had to fight here.
[Saori]: Azusa was forced to return to Trinity, not as the symbol of reconciliation we’d hoped for, but as a murderer and spy.
[Saori]: All this, because of me. Because of my weakness.
[Saori]: Black screen
[Saori]: Why do you always call me? A hound…
[Saori]: Yes. A rabid hound. One that infects everyone around it.
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Back to scene
[Saori]: Why did I call out for Azusa? I have…so many questions for her.
[Saori]: Azusa was a victim of circumstance. She suffered the most in some ways, and yet…
[Saori]: …she seemed so happy.
[Saori]: Azusa was always closed-off. She accepted her presence, but never our friendship.
[Saori]: Her loneliness was palpable.
[Saori]: But then she actually went to Trinity. She went and made friends, met a nice adult…
[Saori]: Azusa overcame all her hardships and suffering with a smile.
[Saori]: She seemed content, in that world beneath a blue sky I could never reach.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: It’s a lie. Don’t you understand? There can be no peace.
[Saori]: Your hope? It’s an illusion! It’ll disappear with the setting sun!!
[Saori]: I’ve prayed! I’ve dreamed and hoped! I’ve lived and loved, and nothing has ever changed!
[Saori]: Everything is in vain, Azusa! Everything!
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: But in the end…
[Saori]: She was right, in the end.
[Saori]: Everything I believed in…my hatred, my resolve…
[Saori]: It was all a lie. Everything isn’t in vain.
[Saori]: My weakness was everyone’s undoing.
[Saori]: Black screen
[Saori]: It was all my fault, Mika.
[Saori]: Azusa couldn’t find happiness until she finally escaped…me.
[Saori]: You know the lengths I went to deny that simple fact.
[Saori]: I want to know…what Azusa has learned. The answers she found at Trinity.
[Saori]: I have so many questions for her.
[Saori]: Black screen
[Saori]: …Can I be happy too, one day?
[Saori]: How can I find peace? Will I ever have the chance? Or more aptly…do I deserve the chance?
[Saori]: What if…
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: What if I had met Sensei first? Instead of Madame?
[Saori]: How would the trajectory of my life have changed?
[Saori]: Maybe I wouldn’t have hurt everyone I love.
[Saori]: If I had…the chance to be good…
[Saori]: I want to understand those words you said to me, Azusa.
[Saori]: I want…
[Saori]: Saori falls
[Saori]: It doesn’t matter anymore… Mika.
[Saori]: Take your revenge. Claim as much as you’ve lost.
[Saori]: You were never a witch. I was the one who injected my hate into your veins.
[Saori]: I’ve took so much from everyone around me. This ending is only fitting.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Well.. I always thought it would be Azusa, but it’s for the best if it’s you, Mika.
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Mika drops her weapon
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: ……
[Mika]: I-I…
[Mika]: I…can’t… I can’t do it…
[Mika]: I can’t…because…
[Mika]: I…
[Mika]: …wanted that, too…
[Mika]: I wanted to be happy!
[Mika]: I’ve wondered that again and again too! What if I had met Sensei earlier? Sensei could’ve helped me fix my mistakes!
[Mika]: I didn’t think it was fair! I messed up… I really did. But I lost everything dear to me. I prayed for some form of mercy.
[Mika]: But...it never came. Not for me.
[Mika]: And now it's too late. I don't think there's anything I could ever do to make up for the horrible things I've done.
[Mika]: A second chance...?
[Mika]: I wanted it so badly. And when Sensei came to my cell and told me all my friends would come to my hearing, I thought I could have it. But...even that slipped away.
[Mika]: ...Everything is in vain, right? There was nothing left for me to do but to
[Mika]: suffer...and to hate.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: You and I...are twin flames, Saori.
[Mika]: Inexplicably linked, cursed to never find happiness.
[Mika]: We can't turn back time, and we can't change the future.
[Mika]: Back to scene
[Mika]: I think that's why I fixated on you. Revenge felt like the only thing I could control.
[Mika]: You didn't turn me into a witch. I took the poison myself.
[Mika]: Even when Sensei tried to give me the antidote, I spit it out.
[Mika]: Like Seia always says, I really am hopeless.
[Mika]: Saori gets up
[Saori]: Mika…
[Mika]: Why haven't you shattered my halo yet?
[Saori]: …!
[Mika]: I know you have the bomb. I've given you plenty of chances to use it.
[Mika]: If you did...then at least I... I wouldn't have to…
[Saori]: I don’t have it.
[Saori]: Sensei confiscated it from me.
[Mika]: Hm?
[Mika]: Confiscated it?
[Mika]: Seriously? Confiscated a deadly weapon like it was some weird magazine or alcohol?
[Mika]: ?
[Mika]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "It's a teacher's duty to confiscate dangerous items."
[Mika]: ?!
[Saori]: Sensei…?!
[Mika]: What are you doing here, Sensei?!
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 19 - Infinite Chances
[Mika]: Sensei appears in front of Saori and Mika. Sensei apologizes to Mika, but Mika insists everything was her fault As Sensei encourages their students, Beatrice, becomes enraged and starts the ritual.
[Saori]: Sensei?! I thought you were going to rescue Hime!
[Sensei]: "I will. With you, Saori."
[Saori]: …!
[Misaki]: Sensei is surprisingly stubborn…
[Hiyori]: Thank goodness you're okay, Leader... I mean...kind of okay. Well, at least you’re alive.
[Saori]: Misaki… Hiyori..
[Sensei]: "You really harmed Saori, Mika."
[Mika]: I… Well…
[Sensei]: "And I'm sorry for all of it, Mika!"
[Mika]: Sensei…?!
[Sensei]: "I should have explained it to you better." / "I should have told you, face-to-face."
[Mika]: I don't understand. What do you mean?
[Mika]: Don't do that, Sensei... This is all my fault.
[Sensei]: "No. I‘m sorry I left you. I had to help Saori and Atsuko."
[Saori]: ….
[Sensei]: "We're going to rescue Atsuko, and then go back to Trinity together."
[Mika]: …!
[Mika]: I-I…
[Mika]: What’s the point?
[Mika]: I'll still be expelled...and even...Seia, thanks to me.
[Sensei]: "Don't worry about any of that."
[Mika]: …!
[Sensei]: "I believe in the person Ifirst met by the pool." / "I know what kind ofa person you are, Mika."
[Mika]: Hahaha. Sensei, you're too much.
[Mika]: You think I'm a good person? You believe I'm a good little student?
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: I’m…a witch.
[Mika]: You can't be that blind, Sensei. You can see the blood on my hands.
[Sensei]: "You're right, Mika. You're my worst student."
[Sensei]: "You lied to others and to yourself." / "You hurt others and yourself."
[Sensei]: "You never know what to do with yourself." / "You cry every time things go wrong."
[Sensei]: "But your kind heart is what made you reach out to Arius." / "But you love everyone around you, with everything you have."
[Sensei]: ?!
[Sensei]: "You're not a witch. You're my student." / "You're just a stubborn, troublesome student."
[Sensei]: "I didn't come for Saori. I came to tell you all this."
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: You…
[Mika]: Can't you just leave me alone, Sensei? Stop torturing me.
[Mika]: After everything I've done, why won't you give up on me?!
[Mika]: Why would you come here and make me believe I have another chance?
[Sensei]: "Of course you have another chance."
[Mika]: …?
[Sensei]: "And if you don't, I'll make one."
[Mika]: That’s…
[Sensei]: "If that one doesn't work out, I'll do it again."
[Sensei]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "And if that doesn't work, I'll try again."
[Sensei]: "And again, and again, and again! I won't stop!"
[Sensei]: "When you fail, you just try again!" / "I won't accept failure for either of you."
[Sensei]: "It doesn't matter if it takes the rest of our lives."
[Sensei]: "I'll give you infinite chances, Mika! Saori!"
[Mika]: …
[Saori]: …
[Sensei]: "You're my students! That's all you need." / "Of course my students get to mess up!" / "I'll make it happen, no matter what!"
[Sensei]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: Cease this foolishness!
[Beatrice]: Back to scene
[Beatrice]: Your nauseating idealism holds no place in my basilica.
[Sensei]: “Beatrice! You…!”
[Beatrice]: Your theatrics have become entirely unamusing.
[Beatrice]: Did you really think I wouldn't be watching you? This entire city belongs to me.
[Beatrice]: I tire of your pathetic attempts to validate your existences, like insects to a flame. The time for games is over!
[Beatrice]: Now then, shall I commence the ritual?
[Saori]: Atsuko! No!
[Misaki]: Are we out of time already?
[Hiyori]: The sun h-hasn't even risen yet...!
[Beatrice]: Ahahahahahaha!
[Beatrice]: Was it fun, holding onto your little hope of "sunrise"? The royal blood's halo will be destroyed before she has the chance to ever lay eyes on the sun again.
[Beatrice]: And with her death, I will rise as the most magnificent being to walk Kivotos!
[Saori]: I'll never let you! Hime, I'm coming!
[Mika]: …
[Beatrice]: Unfortunately, I don't feel like playing with you anymore.
[Beatrice]: Justina soldiers surround Squad and Mika
[Beatrice]: Rise, Barbara, Justina's Saintess.
[Beatrice]: Silence the Schale Sensei! Rip out their lying tongue!
[Beatrice]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Beatrice]: When Beatrice's ritual begins, Seia enters another dream space. There, Seia encounters someone.
[Seia]: Where…?
[Seia]: Seia looks around
[Seia]: I've never been here... Based off the architecture, maybe...the Hyakkiyako district?
[Seia]: Black screen
[???]: Oh, do I have a guest?
[???]: SEX DEMON APPEARS
[Seia]: …!
[???]: I've never encountered another soul in here…
[???]: So, what brings you to this dream?
[Seia]: You can see me? Wh—Who are you?
[???]: …What am I seeing?
[Seia]: …
[???]: …
[???]: <<To be Continued>>
[???]: 20 - Saintess Barbara
[???]: The Arius Squad and Sensei have a harrowing fight against Saintess Barbara of the SaintJustina Council, created by Beatrice.
[???]: Barbara shrieks
[Saori]: Ugh... That thing…
[Hiyori]: H-How scary... It's stronger than anything we've ever encountered...even the artificial angels…
[Misaki]: It's the Saintess of the Saint Justina Council. Her destructive power is tenfold the angels.
[Misaki]: We don't stand a chance.
[Misaki]: Gunfire
[Saori]: Well, we'll have to try! It's coming!
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: <<To be Continued>>
[Saori]: 21 - Breakthrough
[Saori]: Mika sacrifices herself to protect Sensei and the Arius Squad from the Council. Leaving her behind, the rest rush forward to rescue Atsuko.
[Mika]: *pant* *pant*
[Mika]: Justina soldiers surround Mika
[Mika]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "Mika! Are you okay?"
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: ...I'll bait them away.
[Mika]: !?
[Mika]: Twin flames, remember? I get why you need to save Atsuko.
[Mika]: I was...the same way, you know.
[Mika]: So, go. Save her. I'm the only one strong enough to hold them off anyway.
[Mika]: S-Sensei... I'm sorry for being your worst student.
[Mika]: I'll never forget all that you did for me, all the chances you gave me.
[Saori]: You…
[Mika]: Are you gonna waste my valiant sacrifice? Take Sensei and go, Saori!
[Mika]: …
[Saori]: ...Don't die.
[Sensei]: "Mika, stay safe."
[Mika]: Don'tcha know, Sensei? I'm the Tea Party's brawn and muscle. I'll... I'll see you soon.
[Mika]: Mika runs away guns blazin
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: ...She doesn't listen to anyone.
[Saori]: She'll be fine. Let's hurry.
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: The Arius Squad and Sensei arrive at the basilica sanctuary and confronting Beatrice.
[Saori]: *pant* *pant*
[Hiyori]: This is...a holy place…
[Saori]: Hime!
[Misaki]: She's unconscious.
[Hiyori]: W-We have to help... Hime…
[Hiyori]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: Finally. You've arrived, [NAME] Sensei.
[Beatrice]: Back to scene
[Sensei]: “Beatrice!”
[Beatrice]: Heeheehee. Welcome.
[Beatrice]: <<To be Continued>>
[Beatrice]: 22 - Agnus Dei
[Beatrice]: Beatrice asks Sensei to team up with her one last time, and Sensei promptly refuses. Beatrice is greatly angered by this and reveals her true colors.
[Beatrice]: Have you come to save your precious student? What a pity. It's too late.
[Saori]: …!
[Beatrice]: With this ritual, I will harness the powers lurking outside Kivotos and elevate my existence! Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without the royal blood's sacrifice.
[Beatrice]: Sensei, Sensei. You peculiar adversary.
[Beatrice]: I do still believe you and I can come to an understanding.
[Beatrice]: We're not so different. Each of us pursuing what we want, using the knowledge we have garnered in our lifetimes.
[Beatrice]: Is it not an adult's duty to save this world? The more power you amass, the more capable you are of performing that duty.
[Beatrice]: Yes! This ritual will make me into something greater than Kivotos has ever experienced!
[Beatrice]: I will become the highest authority of this land and at last save this useless world! That is my duty as an adult!
[Beatrice]: Who cares for the sacrifice of one little girl in the process?
[Beatrice]: It is nothing in the face of the greater good!
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: This is sublime purpose! This is existence!
[Beatrice]: Back to scene
[Beatrice]: Sensei, do you not relate to me? As their teacher, you too hold the absolute power to absolve or punish the students.
[Sensei]: “You’re wrong.”
[Beatrice]: …?!
[Sensei]: "You've misunderstood entirely." / "I don't have such power."
[Beatrice]: What are you saying?
[Sensei]: "I'm not a judge. I've never had the right to judge anyone."
[Sensei]: "I'm not a savior. I can't shield my students from pain."
[Sensei]: "I'm not an absolute. I can't scrub their sins from this world."
[Beatrice]: …!
[Sensei]: "I'm not some higher authority."
[Beatrice]: I cannot comprehend your existence!
[Beatrice]: How can you explain your power? Your influence? The value your mere existence seems to bring?
[Sensei]: "I'm just a humble teacher."
[Beatrice]: …!
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "I only hold the power to believe in my students when they need it the most."
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Beatrice]: Then prove it!
[Beatrice]: The scene shakes
[Saori]: …!
[Misaki]: What…
[Hiyori]: Oh... Oh, no…
[Beatrice]: Behold! This is my greatness! I am the highest authority!
[Beatrice]: I am a sublime being, meant to rule this world!
[Sensei]: "This is who you really are, Beatrice?"
[Saori]: Madame's real identity…
[Hiyori]: ...is just a monster…
[Misaki]: This is what we've been fighting…
[Sensei]: "Saori. Hiyori. Misaki."
[Saori]: Yes.
[Hiyori]: Yeah!
[Misaki]: …Okay.
[Sensei]: "Don't be afraid. I'm right here."
[Saori]: ...I'm not scared of her.
[Misaki]: Me neither. Let's go.
[Hiyori]: Y-Yeah! We're gonna save Hime!
[Hiyori]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "It's our last mission, Squad!"
[Sensei]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Sensei]: Defeated by the strength of the Arius Squad and Sensei, Beatrice eventually orders all troops to gather at the basilica sanctuary.
[Beatrice]: Arrrrgh! N-No! My manifestation...!
[Beatrice]: How could this be? Was the ritual incomplete... My...power...!
[Beatrice]: You ingrates! Insects! How dare you!
[Beatrice]: Barbara, I summon you... No. I summon all the troops within the basilica!
[Beatrice]: Come to me!.
[Beatrice]: Black screen with shrieking
[Beatrice]: Back to scene
[Saori]: *pant* *pant*
[Hiyori]: Sh-She's summoning more of the scary ghosts?!
[Misaki]: Ugh... We won't last long in our states…
[Saori]: You can still stand, can't you? Pick up your weapons!
[Saori]: Get to her, before reinforcements get here!
[Beatrice]: Gather, my children! Protect your creator!
[Beatrice]: <<To be Continued>>
[Beatrice]: 23 - Kyrie for the Students Part 1
[Beatrice]: Mika, who's been fighting enemies from the Council, is slowly becoming exhausted. She finds a schola cantorum in the Arius cathedral and gets lost in her thoughts. Mika recalls her faults from the past and confronts the Council while singing Kyrie Eleison.
[Beatrice]: Gunfire
[Mika]: *pant* *pant*
[Mika]: This...is the worst. Everything hurts.
[Mika]: Mika staggers while the screen turns black
[Mika]: But I'm not... I'm not done yet.
[Mika]: Footsteps
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Is this a schola cantorum?
[Mika]: A pipe organ...sheet music... It must be.
[Mika]: A gramophone, too. It's funny to think that Arius must have had chapel class, just like us.
[Mika]: Mika tries to play the gramophone
[Mika]: Silly me. Of course it's not working. It's like, a thousand years old at this point.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: *sigh*
[Mika]: Koharu, wasn't it so cool when Sensei showed up to save you?
[Mika]: Yeah, Koharu looked like a princess from a fairy tale that day. I like that kind of story.
[Mika]: A story where the main character shows up and rescues a despairing princess.
[Mika]: Maybe it's a little childish, but I think it's beautiful.
[Mika]: ...I wanted to be a princess, too.
[Mika]: Hah. But I've never heard of a witch who transforms into a princess.
[Mika]: It wouldn't be a fairy tale if the villain got the happy ending.
[Mika]: ...I sure did turn into a villain, huh? I'm sorry, Saori. I really thought it was only fair for you to suffer like I did.
[Mika]: But if I really think about…
[Mika]: I'm sure you just wanted to be saved.
[Mika]: You really are like me. You wanted to find happiness too.
[Mika]: Saori, I know why you're obsessed with Atsuko…
[Mika]: Even if you lied, cheated, and hurt everyone around you, it would all be okay if it meant saving your princess.
[Mika]: You thought maybe you could absolve yourself, just a little bit. Am I right?
[Mika]: I know because Seia and I both thought the same way.
[Mika]: Distant shriek
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: That's why I'm rooting for you, Squad.
[Mika]: I'll pray for your salvation.
[Mika]: Just as I desperately wish for my suffering to subside…
[Mika]: I hope yours does as well.
[Mika]: Just as I wish and pray and beg for a second chance.
[Mika]: I hope you get infinite chances.
[Mika]: I long to be forgiven…
[Mika]: ...so I forgive you.
[Mika]: I like that ending better than anything "fair."
[Mika]: Justina troops marching
[Mika]: Even if you save Atsuko, your future will be filled with suffering.
[Mika]: You'll be chased for the rest your life, wandering through dirty back alleys, living a cold, hungry, miserable life.
[Mika]: But if despite that…
[Mika]: If despite all that you truly believe you can find happiness in your future…
[Mika]: Save Atsuko. Save yourselves.
[Mika]: It's too late for me...but I weirdly believe you guys can do it.
[Mika]: Sensei will be by your side, whenever you need them.
[Mika]: Yeah... Sensei will help you through it.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: I really do hope you find the answers to your questions.
[Mika]: Back to scene
[Mika]: The gramophone makes a noise
[Mika]: Huh?
[Mika]: Kyrie Eleison plays
[Mika]: The gramophone? How did it start working...?
[Mika]: Mika listens to the tune for a moment
[Mika]: Ah... A song of mercy.
[Mika]: I never did like this song very much.
[Mika]: Well, enough of my monologue.
[Mika]: Justina troops marching
[Mika]: Where are you going in such a hurry, huh? Do you have a class reunion or something?
[Mika]: I can't let you pass, unfortunately. Past here, the characters of a fairy tale are fighting for their salvation.
[Mika]: Villains like us aren't allowed to enter.
[Mika]: Okay, Sensei. Save those kids.
[Mika]: I'll guard this place, one way or another.
[Mika]: –Kyrie Eleison
[Mika]: –Kyrie Eleison
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 24 - Kyrie for the Students Part 2
[Mika]: Beatrice is taken aback by Kyrie Eleison resonating in the basilica sanctuary. When Barbara and her troops don‘t show up because of the song, Beatrice becomes very angry and tries to sacrifice Saori.
[Beatrice]: …
[Beatrice]: What is happening? Where are the reinforcements...?
[Beatrice]: Where is Barbara? I summon you!
[Beatrice]: Kyrie Eleison plays
[Beatrice]: …!
[Hiyori]: This song…
[Misaki]: This is...Kyrie Eleison?
[Sensei]: "Mika! It's Mika!"
[Beatrice]: It cannot be!
[Beatrice]: No! The song of mercy cannot play in my territory!
[Beatrice]: This should be impossible! What trickery is this?
[Beatrice]: I ensured the instruments and gramophones were broken. Is this a twisted miracle?
[Beatrice]: I won't believe it. It must be a curse! Only hatred and contempt can echo within my halls.
[Beatrice]: Every last one of you deserves to rot and suffer in this hell! You deserve no salvation!
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Sensei]: “Shut up.”
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Sensei]: !
[Beatrice]: What did you say to me?!
[Sensei]: "Don't ever speak to my precious students again."
[Beatrice]: …!!!
[Sensei]: "You lied to my students and hurt them." / "I will never forgive the pain you caused my students."
[Beatrice]: How dare you speak to me this way!
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: ARGHHHH!!!
[Beatrice]: The scene shakes
[Hiyori]: Sh-She's changing again?!
[Beatrice]: I will not be defeated! Saori, come to your master!
[Beatrice]: You will be the new sacrifice!
[Saori]: …!
[Beatrice]: You were the one who brought Sensei here! You must be punished!
[Beatrice]: …
[Saori]: Yes, Madame.
[Hiyori]: L-Leader?!
[Misaki]: What in the seven hells do you think you're doing?
[Saori]: My Arius Squad... I would sacrifice myself a thousand times over to make up for what I've done to all of you.
[Saori]: Well, Madame? Come and get me!
[Misaki]: That idiotic— Sensei! We have to go! Now!
[Sensei]: "We'll rid this world of Beatrice for good!"
[Hiyori]: Yes! I'm ready!
[Saori]: BEATRICE!!!
[Saori]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Saori]: Beatrice is defeated by the Arius Squad and Sensei. The Arius Squad rescues Atsuko, who's been freed from Beatrice's ritual. Then Golconde, a member of Gematria, appears in front of them and disappears with Beatrice.
[Beatrice]: Argh! Graaah!
[Beatrice]: H-How...! Why...? My…
[Beatrice]: My plan...my territory...my ritual…
[Beatrice]: My...my...power!
[Beatrice]: Ahhhh!
[Beatrice]: Beatrice falls
[Saori]: *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...
[Hiyori]: I-Is it...over?
[Hiyori]: !
[Hiyori]: Ack! Is Hime okay?!
[Saori]: Atsuko! No!
[Misaki]: She's still up there. I don't know if she's…
[Hiyori]: Get her down! P-Please! Right now!
[Hiyori]: Black screen with running
[Hiyori]: Oh no…
[Saori]: Hime! Hime! Wake up! P-Please...wake up…
[Hiyori]: H-Hime…
[Misaki]: Her injuries... She's lost too much blood.
[Saori]: Hime... A-Atsuko... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...so please, just open your eyes... I'll do anything…
[Saori]: Don't...d-don't leave me. Hime...!
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Hiyori]: Fade to black
[Atsuko]: Saori…?
[Saori]: A-Atsuko! Yes! Yes, it's me!
[Misaki]: Hime!
[Hiyori]: H-Hime! Can you hear us?!
[Atsuko]: Good morning.
[Atsuko]: Saori, Hiyori, Misaki... I'm back.
[Atsuko]: Black screen
[Saori]: Welcome back, Atsuko. You're home.
[Atsuko]: Hi, Saori.
[Saori]: Hime. Y—You're alive. You're okay.
[Atsuko]: I'm...right here.
[Saori]: I can feel you in my arms, so I can believe it. Thank you... Thank you for surviving, Atsuko.
[Atsuko]: You... You came for me. You saved me.
[Saori]: *sob*
[Atsuko]: No more tears, Saori. I'm safe...thanks to you.
[Atsuko]: Sensei...helped us?
[Saori]: Yes. If it weren't for them…
[Saori]: Thank you, Sensei. Everything's okay now, Saori. I can feel it.
[Atsuko]: Yes. Everything is okay now.
[Sensei]: Go to Beatrice on the ground.
[Beatrice]: U-Ugh…
[Sensei]: "It's over, Beatrice."
[Beatrice]: I'll never be defeated...not by you...!
[Beatrice]: You think you've won? All you did was disrupt my ritual, Sensei!
[Beatrice]: I still have Barbara and the Arius troops! I still have Mimesis!
[Beatrice]: Don't look down at me like that! You've won nothing! You think everything is over now?!
[Beatrice]: Black screen
[???]: Not everything, but it's time to close this little storybook.
[Sensei]: “...!”
[Beatrice]: Golconde?!
[Golconde]: Now, now. Let's skip the theatrics. I am terribly sorry if I surprised you. I am Golconde of Gematria.
[Golconde]: Although introductions may be unnecessary, Sensei. We've met before. Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows!
[Golconde]: Put those silly little weapons down. I'm only here to retrieve Madame.
[Beatrice]: Me?!
[Golconde]: I'm not in the business of picking a fool's fight! Not all Gematria can turn into monsters like Madame, after all.
[Golconde]: And yes, yes. Madame, this was not your story to enter, and Sensei was not your rival. Even I can SEE that! Hahaha, get it?
[Beatrice]: …!
[Golconde]: The events, conflicts, and processes you started are now insignificant bygones.
[Golconde]: My beautiful Madame. You aren't the main character nor the antagonist. Instead, look up the term "plot device" in the dictionary.
[Beatrice]: U-Ugh...!
[Golconde]: Sensei, wherever you intervene, you rewrite the story with your desired ending. If not for you, our poor Madame would have been successful.
[Golconde]: Your chosen form of conflict resolution was believing in your students? A bit bland and overdone, if you ask me.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Golconde]: Oh dear, oh dear. HaveI made you uncomfortable? That's ever so rude of me.
[Golconde]: I'll return with Madame now. Please, stand up, Madame.
[Golconde]: Black screen
[Beatrice]: *cough* You're…
[Sensei]: “Wait…!”
[Sensei]: Back to scene
[Golconde]: Do you plan to stop me? I would strongly recommend against that, Sensei.
[Golconde]: I can utilize various tools. The halo-destroying bomb you have is one of my creations.
[Sensei]: “...!”
[Golconde]: Oh my, I wouldn't detonate it in this holy place. It wouldn't be effective against you at all. Not a tiny bit.
[Golconde]: I never was able to confirm if it could successfully destroy a halo. Hm. I suppose I'll just throw it away.
[Golconde]: Madame, your experiment has failed. Off we go.
[Beatrice]: Golconde!!
[Golconde]: Excuse us. I'll see you again, Sensei.
[Golconde]: Beatrice and Golconde leave
[Golconde]: <<To be Continued>>
[Golconde]: 25 - Someone Special
[Golconde]: After successfully rescuing Atsuko, Saori tells Sensei that she will pay for all her sins. However, Sensei tells her to focus on living her life and leaves to find Mika. Meanwhile, Mika is fighting against Barbara and the Council, but she reaches her limit and is about to give up. At that moment, Sensei appears to Mika's surprise. Sensei is furious with Barbara and the Council for hurting their student.
[Sensei]: "Is everyone okay?"
[Misaki]: I can stand, at least.
[Saori]: Yes…
[Hiyori]: I-Is it really over?
[Saori]: Beatrice…
[Sensei]: “She ran away.”
[Sensei]: !
[Saori]: She got away?
[Sensei]: "But she won't be able to hurt you anymore."
[Saori]: …
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Atsuko]: Sensei, thank you for helping us.
[Sensei]: "I'm glad you're okay. Do you need your mask?"
[Atsuko]: ...I think I'll be fine.
[Atsuko]: Madame was the one who gave me that mask.
[Atsuko]: When I got caught in Azusa's bomb, some kind of a device protected my body. I believe it was from the mask.
[Atsuko]: It must have been Madame's failsafe. To ensure I didn't die before the ritual.
[Sensei]: "Then you should wear it when you need it." / "A lot of people would be sad if you got hurt, Atsuko."
[Saori]: …
[Atsuko]: You're correct. I never want to have to hide my voice again...but I will keep myself safe.
[Saori]: Okay. Sensei.
[Saori]: We saved Hime. You can do whatever you need to now.
[Sensei]: "Whatever I need...?"
[Saori]: I was the culprit behind everything... The Eden Treaty incident, the Seia and Nagisa attacks... Misaki, Hiyori, and Atsuko's pain... I'm responsible for all of it.
[Saori]: The General Student Council, Trinity...or the Corrections Bureau... Send me wherever you think is fitting.
[Misaki]: What are you saying, Saori?
[Hiyori]: L-Leader?!
[Atsuko]: …
[Misaki]: This is a bad joke, Leader.
[Saori]: No... I've done too much harm with no consequences.
[Saori]: But I'm ready now. I want to take responsibility.
[Hiyori]: L-Leader…
[Sensei]: “………” / "You're right. You‘re responsible for a lot, Saori."
[Sensei]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "You've been responsible for protecting everyone around you, all this time."
[Sensei]: "You've been taking care of them, protecting them, and enduring the pain." / "You've shouldered that responsibility all by yourself."
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: "You grew out of the concrete and had to adapt." / "You made horrible decisions and learned even worse lessons."
[Sensei]: "You're all delinquent students who've caused everyone trouble."
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: …
[Sensei]: "But that doesn‘t mean you deserve to suffer."
[Sensei]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "Kids deserve to make mistakes. Kids don't deserve hurt and pain." / "Adults like me are responsible for creating a world that hurt you."
[Saori]: What are you saying? That's...!
[Saori]: Then... What do I do? What am I supposed to do now, Sensei?
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: Leader…
[Atsuko]: …
[Sensei]: "You're just supposed to live, Saori."
[Saori]: Live...? I don't understand.
[Atsuko]: I do. I think.
[Saori]: Hime?
[Atsuko]: Saori, is there anything you want to do?
[Atsuko]: …
[Saori]: Azusa said she liked learning and spending time with her friends.
[Atsuko]: Is there anything you want to try? What do you WANT to do, Saori?
[Atsuko]: Do you have a favorite food? You've never spoken of anything except protecting us.
[Atsuko]: What do you want to be when you grow up? Do you have any dreams?
[Saori]: I’ve never…
[Saori]: I don't know... I've never thought about anything like that before…
[Saori]: What I like? What I want? They're foreign concepts to me…
[Atsuko]: Saori, you're responsible, strong, and…
[Hiyori]: A-And you're really good at teaching, even though you're kinda scary…
[Misaki]: You never stop working and can come up with a plan in any situation. And you take so much initiative it exhausts me.
[Saori]: …
[Sensei]: "Hmm, I see. Then Saori could..."
[Sensei]: "...be a good teacher one day."
[Saori]: …!
[Hiyori]: L-Leader as a teacher?!
[Misaki]: It is hard to imagine, isn't it?
[Atsuko]: Do you think so? I can see it perfectly.
[Saori]: But I can't fathom having a future at all, let alone what I would do with it.
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: I've never thought about life beyond surviving the current moment. I don't know what that means...to just live.
[Saori]: I…
[Saori]: Do I deserve...to dream of a future?
[Sensei]: "You need to find those answers on your own, Saori."
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: …
[Misaki]: …
[Atsuko]: …
[Atsuko]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "With that, it's time to say goodbye, Squad."
[Sensei]: !?
[Saori]: You're leaving? S-Sensei!
[Sensei]: "I'm sorry, but another student needs my help."
[Saori]: W-Wait. I'm not ready…
[Saori]: I… We…
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: No, you’re right.
[Saori]: I'll find the answer on my own.
[Sensei]: "I know you will, Saori. I‘ve always known."
[Saori]: …!
[Saori]: Black screen with footsteps
[Saori]: Back to scene
[Hiyori]: S-Sensei left so fast!
[Misaki]: They went to go find Mika.
[Hiyori]: Mika is kinda...scary... Will Sensei be okay?
[Atsuko]: They will be. Sensei was okay last time.
[Saori]: Last time?
[Atsuko]: Yes, and every other time. Sensei will have a plan.
[Atsuko]: Beatrice and all her powers suppressing the Arius district have disappeared.
[Saori]: …
[Hiyori]: Leader…
[Atsuko]: Saori? How are you feeling?
[Saori]: I'm okay. I'm confused, and I don't really understand everything Sensei said yet.
[Saori]: But for the first time in my life, I feel like it's okay for me to be alive.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Gunfire
[Saori]: Justina troops approaching
[Saori]: Black screen
[Mika]: *cough* *cough*
[Mika]: Back to scene
[Mika]: Ugh. I'm so not cute right now.
[Mika]: It hurts a lot, but at leastI made it to sunrise.
[Mika]: Atsuko was saved successfully by now, right?
[Mika]: With Sensei by their side, Saori and the rest must have had their happy ending.
[Mika]: Screech
[Mika]: That's...good... What a relief…
[Mika]: Justina approaching
[Mika]: Yeesh, I guess this is it for me. I'm sorry, Sensei.
[Mika]: I really would've gone back with you, ifI had the chance.
[Mika]: Barbara screeches
[Mika]: Footsteps
[Sensei]: “Mika!”
[Mika]: S-S-Sensei...?!
[Sensei]: "I'm sorry I'm late. Did you wait long?"
[Mika]: It's really you. What are you doing here?!
[Sensei]: "Infinite chances, remember?"
[Mika]: …!
[Sensei]: "Whenever you're in danger, I'll come running."
[Mika]: B-But...I'm the villain here…
[Mika]: I don't deserve your mercy…
[Mika]: Did you think this through? How are you going to fight the Council?
[Mika]: I-I'm the strongest, and I couldn't do anything. It's honestly unfair, how strong they are.
[Mika]: You have to run, Sensei. I won't let you get hurt for me.
[Sensei]: "Mika, you really are a troublemaker."
[Sensei]: "But I won't abandon even my bad students." / "No teacher should turn away from a student in danger!"
[Sensei]: !
[Sensei]: Take out your credit card.
[Sensei]: Sensei looks at Barbara
[Sensei]: "How...how dare you..."
[Sensei]: Fade to white
[Sensei]: "How dare you treat my precious student like that!" / "How dare you treat my precious princess like that!"

[Mika]: Wow…
[Mika]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Mika]: Just as the Arius students are in a panic because they can't get in touch with Beatrice, Trinity forces suddenly pour out from the catacombs.
[Arius Student A]: What happened? Why can't we reach Madame?
[Arius Student B]: Emergency! The catacombs have been breached!
[Arius Student B]: Trinity forces are pouring out of the entrances!
[Arius Student A]: H-How is that possible?
[Arius Student A]: Black screen with explosions
[Justice Task Force Member A]: This way!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: Let’s go!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: ?!
[Arius Student A]: Wh-Who are you?!
[Mine]: So, this is the Arius district.
[Mine]: It's as Seia said. This place needed our aid, not repudiation.
[Arius Student B]: Stop right there!
[Arius Student B]: Mine fucking kills them
[Mine]: Forgive me. I allowed my personal memories and feelings to impede my duties, all this time.
[Mine]: Serina, Hanae. Treat them.
[Serina]: Yes, Captain!
[Mine]: From here on out, your role is to quickly rescue and treat any enemies I injure.
[Mine]: Stay close behind me!
[Serina]: Captain…
[Hanae]: This is our motto: Mine destroys everything and her knights pick up the pieces! It's like self-generating infinite power!
[Serina]: I-I don't know ifI would call that a motto...or even a correct statement…
[Mine]: Remedial Knights! Remain diligent!
[Mine]: Go forth with faith and honor in your heart! Medicine knows no borders!
[Mine]: Charge! Liberate the Arius district and save Sense! and Mika!
[Hanae]: Yeah!
[Serina]: I can't believe we're on such a big mission at the break of dawn... Augh!
[Serina]: <<To be Continued>>
[Serina]: 26 - Our Future
[Serina]: While Sensei and Mika are fighting in Arius, other Trinity students work together to save them.
[Hasumi]: Stay sharp, everyone! Follow Seia's instructions or you'll be lost in the catacombs!
[Justice Task Force Member A]: Yes, ma'am!
[Hasumi]: Ichika, please report. Did you find Sensei yet?
[Ichika]: *tchhhk* Yes, we've found Sensei! But Tsurugi is a bit... Well…
[Hasumi]: Tsurugi? Is she okay?
[Hasumi]: Fade to black and explosions
[Ichika]: Tsurugi, please. That's a wall, not a door.
[Ichika]: Ugh. Too late.
[Tsurugi]: ...Kekekeke.
[Tsurugi]: Kyaaaaaak!!
[Tsurugi]: Black screen and explosions
[Sensei]: “Tsurugi…”
[Mika]: What is theJustice Task Force doing here?
[Ichika]: Greetings, Sensei. I'm Ichika from theJustice Task Force.
[Ichika]: We met briefly at the Gourmet Research Society arrest, but never formally. I'm here to rescue you!
[Sensei]: "Thanks, Ichika. It's good to see you again."
[Ichika]: Heehee. Pleasure's all mine.
[Ichika]: Hasumi, Ichika reporting in. We've secured Sensei and Mika.
[Hasumi]: *tchhhk* Great job. Retreat to a safe zone as soon as possible. We've secured a route in the catacombs.
[Ichika]: All according to plan! Are you two ready? There's some people eagerly awaiting your safe return.
[Ichika]: ?
[Ichika]: !
[Nagisa]: Sensei! Mika! Thank goodness you're unharmed.
[Mika]: Nagi?! How are you here? Am I dead?
[Nagisa]: You're certainly not. You are currently standing in the command center of the Arius reclamation operation.
[Mika]: But...how?! How did you get through the catacombs?
[Mika]: Black screen
[Seia]: I showed her the way.
[Sensei]: “Seia?!”
[Sensei]: !?
[Mika]: S…
[Mika]: Seia…
[Seia]: You really are a dummy, Mika.
[Seia]: As usual, your impulsiveness ruined things. I've always said it was your worst trait.
[Mika]: And you're always such a meanie! But wh-what happened? Are you okay?
[Seia]: It's a bit of a long story.
[Seia]: Fade to white showing the SEX DEMON
[Seia]: Back to scene
[Seia]: I met someone in a dream.
[Seia]: It was a long journey but, to summarize, I made a deal and escaped Beatrice's grasp.
[Seia]: <<Flashback sequence>>
[Hanae]: Seia…?!
[Seia]: *cough* *cough*
[Serina]: C-Captain! Seia... Seia is...!
[Seia]: Please... I need Nagisa... And bring the Sisterhood and the Justice Task Force here. Hurry.
[Hanae]: What? O-Okay! If you say so!
[Seia]: There's no time. Sensei and Mika are in grave danger.
[Seia]: <<End of flashback>>
[Seia]: As soon as I woke up, I asked for the Sisterhood, the Remedial Knights, and the Justice Task Force.
[Seia]: During that talk, Nagisa swore she would abdicate all her authority if we could just save you, Mika.
[Seia]: <<Flashback sequence>>
[Nagisa]: I beg of you to help me. Please save Mika.
[Seia]: I implore you as well.
[Sakurako]: …
[Hasumi]: This is…
[Mine]: Raise your heads, Nagisa. Seia. You need not bow to us.
[Mine]: I understand Mika's situation. But also, Seia, I'm relieved to see you recovered. What happened?
[Seia]: It's...a long story…
[Mine]: ...Understood.
[Mine]: I will not pry. For now.
[Sakurako]: More importantly, Sensei's safety is the priority. The Sisterhood will support this operation.
[Hasumi]: There are many students at Trinity who owe Sensei, including me. They'll be glad to help.
[Seia]: Thank you. And please, stay safe.
[Azusa]: This is all I know of the catacombs' changing patterns.
[Sakurako]: This couldn't have been easy. Thank you, Azusa.
[Azusa]: But...are you sure I can't go too?
[Sakurako]: Then who will greet Sensei when we return victorious?
[Sakurako]: And our reputation wouldn't last long if we need the Make-Up Work Club's help again...especially from you, for this particular mission.
[Sakurako]: Even Hanako is staying behind to support us the best way she can.
[Sakurako]: Trust in us.
[Azusa]: O-Okay.
[Azusa]: U-Umm…
[Sakurako]: It's okay. What would you like to say?
[Sakurako]: …
[Azusa]: Please save Atsuko.
[Sakurako]: If I know Sensei, Atsuko is already safe. And we'll make sure to keep Sensei safe.
[Azusa]: Thank you. And...I hope everyone else can be saved too.
[Sakurako]: Even though they pointed their guns at you? At your friends?
[Azusa]: Even so. They may be villains who‘ve committed heinous crimes…
[Azusa]: Black screen
[Azusa]: But they were my family.
[Ui]: U-Ugh... Do you know what time it is right now?
[Hanako]: Yes. It's so early that not even the birds are awake. Now let's search that map, Ui.
[Ui]: Wait a second... What are you wearing?
[Hanako]: Oh, this? I was taking a walk...I mean, I was swimming when I heard the message.
[Hanako]: I don't think this is it. Let's go to the next page.
[Ui]: Which one is it? Were you swimming or talking a walk?
[Ui]: !
[Hanako]: Wait! Here it is! The old map of the catacombs left by that ancient council!
[Ui]: Th-This page? It's about to crumble apart...and it's badly faded…
[Hanako]: Yes, that's whyI came to see you, Ui. You're the Magician of the Old Library.
[Ui]: Ughhh, argh…
[Hanako]: You can restore it, right? Time is of the essence.
[Hanako]: I know you can do it, Kozeki! I'll help you in every way possible! ♡
[Ui]: Ugh... How did I get involved in this?
[Ichika]: Move, move! We don't have a moment to spare!
[Justice Task Force Members]: Yes, ma'am!
[Koharu]: Umm…
[Ichika]: Huh? You're...Koharu?
[Koharu]: Y-Yes! I-I'm also from the Justice Task Force...but I'm in the Make-Up Work Club right now, so I'm not allowed to go.
[Koharu]: Do you think you could give these to a high-ranking person in the Tea Party for me? Please?
[Koharu]: Koharu gives something to Ichika
[Ichika]: What are these? A ribbon and some accessories?
[Koharu]: They belong to someone from the Tea Party. They were in the Justice Task Force's contraband storage.
[Ichika]: Oh, I understand now. They're Mika's, aren't they?
[Ichika]: I heard they were stolen and burned by angry students. I guess what the Justice Task Force recovered got mixed in with the confiscated items.
[Koharu]: Technically, yes. I was secretly taking items that were in decent condition. I know I'm not supposed to do that, but…
[Ichika]: ...I see. Okay, Koharu.
[Ichika]: I'll give them to Mika.
[Koharu]: Really? Thank you!
[Koharu]: Koharu runs away
[Koharu]: <<End of flashback>>
[Mika]: Everyone…
[Seia]: We can't rely on Sensei for everything. Every relationship should go both ways.
[Seia]: So, we came here on our own to save you, Mika.
[Mika]: You really are such a narcissist! You make everything sound so self-important and complicated!
[Mika]: ?
[Mika]: I've always wanted to say that out loud to you!
[Mika]: But you know what? I like you a whole lot, Seia.
[Seia]: …?
[Mika]: And Nagi! Are you kidding me? She brought tea all the way to the Arius District?
[Mika]: ?
[Mika]: Is she a tea addict? Does she have a serious problem?
[Mika]: ButI like Nagi more than anything, tea and all.
[Nagisa]: I don't know how to feel about that statement.
[Nagisa]: …?
[Mika]: You guys are my favorite.
[Mika]: Thank you for coming for me. And I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
[Nagisa]: Mika…
[Seia]: Stop, Mika. I'm the one who owes you an apology.
[Seia]: All this time, I told myself I was waiting for the perfect moment to apologize.
[Seia]: But in reality, I was being immature. I was avoiding it.
[Seia]: Mika. When you told me you wanted to reconcile with Arius—
[Mika]: It's okay, Seia. You didn't do anything wrong.
[Mika]: It's all my fault. I'm just so sorry.
[Nagisa]: Mika…
[Seia]: Mika…
[Ichika]: I'm sorry for crashing the reunion, but I have something for you, Mika.
[Mika]: You do? For me?
[Ichika]: Here.
[Mika]: This…
[Mika]: My accessories?! How do you have these? I thought they were burned with everything else!
[Ichika]: There was a member in charge of the contraband storage…
[Ichika]: Ugh, how do I explain this...?
[Ichika]: That student collected the accessories that didn't burn and hid them away.
[Mika]: Koharu…?
[Ichika]: Yes, it was Koharu.
[Ichika]: Woah! You know who Koharu is?
[Mika]: ...Yes, I do.
[Mika]: Tell her I say thank you. I can't believe she did this, even though I always bullied her.
[Seia]: …
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: "I'm sure you have a lot to talk to each other about."
[Seia]: I would say so.
[Nagisa]: But for now, I believe we all have a hearing to attend.
[Seia]: Yes.
[Mika]: W-Wait. You want me to go to my hearing looking like this?
[Mika]: Can I take a shower first? I want treatment for my wounds and to get my hair done. With a fancy curler!
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: …
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Yes, Mika. You may have the fancy curler as well.
[Nagisa]: Yes, and then all three of us will go to the hearing together. Although, we all look a bit of a mess.
[Sensei]: "I'm coming too."
[Nagisa]: Yes, of course. All of us promised Mika we would attend, didn't we?
[Nagisa]: <<To be Continued>>
[Nagisa]: 27 - Epilogue
[Nagisa]: As the Arius Squad is escaping the Arius district, they realize that Saori has suddenly disappeared. The remaining three resolve to continue moving forward. Meanwhile, Mika's hearing finally begins.
[Hiyori]: I-I've never gone this way before…
[Hiyori]: What if it takes us somewhere horrible?
[Atsuko]: We won't know until we try, Hiyori.
[Atsuko]: From now on, every path we take is an unknown.
[Hiyori]: ...That doesn't make it less scary.
[Hiyori]: ?
[Hiyori]: …Huh?
[Hiyori]: Wh-Where's Leader?!
[Atsuko]: Huh?
[Hiyori]: Wasn't she behind us?! She disappeared! Maybe she was eaten…
[Misaki]: …Tsk.
[Atsuko]: Misaki…?
[Misaki]: Leader left.
[Hiyori]: Left?! What do you mean l-Ieft? How could she leave? Where'd she go?
[Misaki]: I don't know. She just said to take care of the others.
[Hiyori]: But why? Leader…
[Atsuko]: …
[Misaki]: It's unfair, Saori. If I have to do this on my own... I…
[Misaki]: It's too heavy for me.
[Atsuko]: It'll be okay, Misaki.
[Misaki]: Hime!
[Atsuko]: Saori will need some time.
[Atsuko]: She needs to learn who she is, to reflect on her questions.
[Atsuko]: She'll find the answers she needs on her own.
[Hiyori]: B-But...will she come back? I miss her already…
[Atsuko]: Of course. She would never abandon us.
[Hiyori]: So we have to keep going on our own? Without her?
[Atsuko]: Saori has taken care of us all these years. We owe her this much.
[Misaki]: But how?
[Misaki]: Where do we go?
[Misaki]: Arius, Trinity, Gehenna... We're not welcome anywhere.
[Misaki]: We'll be on the run. Never staying in one spot too long to avoid capture.
[Misaki]: Are you prepared for that life, Hime?
[Atsuko]: Yes. I was prepared the moment we decided to live.
[Misaki]: …
[Hiyori]: Oh no…
[Misaki]: Hime. Ideals won't feed an empty stomach.
[Atsuko]: I know. But we can do it.
[Misaki]: …
[Atsuko]: Wildflowers bloom through cracks in the concrete.
[Atsuko]: Azusa said that to me once.
[Atsuko]: We will continue struggling, even if it is in vain.
[Atsuko]: If Azusa did it, so can we. We've been through a lot together.
[Atsuko]: And this time, we're not entirely alone.
[Hiyori]: …Sensei.
[Misaki]: …Okay.
[Misaki]: Somehow…
[Atsuko]: Yes. We have our work cut out for us.
[Atsuko]: Fade to black
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Saori walks away
[Black Market Officer]: Heeheehee. What's your story, newbie? No one ends up here without one.
[Black Market Officer]: Not the talkative type? Eh, I don't care either way as long as you're skilled. What kind of request you looking for? Easy or hard?
[Saori]: Give me an expensive mission. The hardest one you have.
[Saori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: (I'm a criminal on the run now. I know it won't be easy.)
[Saori]: (But there has to be an end to the road of pain I've walked all these years.)
[Saori]: (Is there a happy future for us if I reach it?)
[Atsuko]: We'll have our happy ending.
[Atsuko]: I have faith in the wildflower blooming in concrete.
[Atsuko]: I have faith in you, Saori.
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: …
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Fade to black
[Seia]: Sensei. I'm unable to have prophetic dreams anymore.
[Seia]: That was the price I paid to escape my neverending dream.
[Seia]: I have to discuss my last prophetic dream with you.
[Seia]: One day, though.
[Seia]: Right now, I want to remember this moment.
[Seia]: We've all finally been reunited.
[Seia]: And, as always, we will work together to overcome any obstacle.
[Seia]: Back to scene
[Sensei]: "Okay, let‘s start the hearing."
[Saori]: This isn't what I'm owed!
[Black Market Officer]: Hm? I don't follow.
[Saori]: What's with this? This isn't even half of what I was promised!
[Black Market Officer]: You're the one who broke our promise.
[Black Market Officer]: It says right here on the contract, student pay is a thousand yen.
[Black Market Officer]: But you hid the fact you were a dropout, so it's five hundred yen.
[Saori]: What? Wait, that's…
[Black Market Officer]: This is the calculation after subtracting taxes, various expenses, and meals. Any problems?
[Black Market Officer]: Also, it looks like you're wanted. Wouldn't you get in trouble if anyone knew you were here?
[Black Market Officer]: I'll have to deduct an additional fifteen percent as an information protection cost.
[Saori]: What? Wait, then...how much do I get...?
[Saori]: Keyboard clicking
[Black Market Officer]: Zilch. Nada. Nothing.
[Black Market Officer]: The exit is right that way.
[Black Market Officer]: Do you have any complaints? I'm sure you could direct them to the Valkyrie Police Academy.
[Black Market Officer]: …
[Saori]: ...No, I get it.
[Saori]: I'll consider this lesson learned.
[Saori]: Knocking
[Saori]: ?
[Haruka]: E-Excuse me.
[Black Market Officer]: Oh, you're...the one I gave the commission to last time...?!
[Haruka]: Oh, yes, yes... U-Umm... I forgot something…
[Black Market Officer]: Forgot something? But we've already finished the calculations.
[Haruka]: U-um, right. S-So…
[Haruka]: …
[Haruka]: F-Forgive…
[Black Market Officer]: Forgive?
[Haruka]: I won’t forgive you!!!
[Haruka]: Black screen and haruka fucking kills the guy
[Black Market Officer]: UNFORGIVABLE!!!
[Haruka]: How dare you steal Aru's money?! I'll never forgive you! I'll make you wish you'd never been born!
[Haruka]: Haruka absolutely fucking kills him
[Haruka]: Eek.
[Haruka]: A-Aru said I should go and make my point...to do the calculations correctly…
[Haruka]: I-I thinkI made my point...?
[Saori]: …
[Haruka]: O-Oh! I didn't know there was someone else here!
[Haruka]: I-I'm so sorry for the commotion! I'm sorry f-for existing!
[Saori]: ...It's not a big deal.
[Haruka]: O-Okay! Th-Then I have some bombs to install... Bye!
[Saori]: Is this how the criminal world operates?
[Aru]: Wh-What?!
[Haruka]: I-I'm sorry.... I'm sorry. I just don't know how to do anything right. I'm sorry for upsetting you. Do you want me to disappear? I should never have been born.
[Kayoko]: *sigh*
[Mutsuki]: Ahahahaha! You're really the best, Haruka! You definitely made your point!
[Mutsuki]: Those were some big, bad guys you blew up. Whatcha gonna do now, huh?
[Kayoko]: This is gonna be a pain. Can we have one day of peace?
[Kayoko]: …
[Kayoko]: Fade to black
[Kayoko]: <<END OF CHAPTER>>
