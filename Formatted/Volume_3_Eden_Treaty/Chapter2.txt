[Chapter 2]: Paradise Paradox
[Chapter 2]: Conspiracy and betrayal, suspicion and doubt, scheming and shadow wars are running rampant. Will Sensei be able to safely overcome the crisis with the Make-Up Work Club students?
[Chapter 2]: 01 - The Great Leviathan
[Chapter 2]: Mika says that Nagisa is after something using the Eden Treaty. Claiming that Azusa must be protected in order to stop Nagisa, Mika asks Sensei to choose whether to trust her or to trust Nagisa.
[Sensei]: “Azusa is the traitor?”
[Mika]: That she is, and I would like you to protect her.
[Mika]: I guess getting straight to the point doesn't make sense without all of the details. Nagi's bad habits might be rubbing off on me.
[Mika]: How about I explain it from the beginning?
[Mika]: I'm not as good at this kind of thing as Nagi or Seia are…
[Mika]: ...but I'll give it my best shot!
[Sensei]: "O-Okay."
[Mika]: First is what defines Trinity General Academy. As I'm sure Nagi told you, our academy's history is built on several factions coming together.
[Mika]: As the name would suggest, there are three such factions that comprise its center: Pater, Filius, and Sanctus.
[Mika]: However, there were many other smaller factions, such as the Remedial Knights and the Sisterhood.
[Mika]: Back then, those factions were just as hostile toward one another as Trinity and Gehenna are today.
[Mika]: Conflict was a daily occurrence—growing worse by the day.
[Mika]: Until finally they all came together and created a peace treaty.
[Mika]: And so the First Council was held, where it was agreed to end the bloodshed and unite as one academy.
[Sensei]: "That sounds familiar."
[Mika]: It does, doesn't it?
[Mika]: Trinity General School as we know it was born from that First Council.
[Mika]: There are still traces of those factions even today, but most people would never know it. Over time, history tends to become rather faded.
[Mika]: However, there was one academy that chose not to participate in the council.
[Mika]: The Arius faction.
[Mika]: I say "faction," but it's been an organized academy much like our own for a long time.
[Mika]: The two sides had much in common, but were driven apart due to differences in how to interpret the ancient scriptures.
[Mika]: Their academy also held chapel classes, kept a strict conservative uniform, and had a strong contempt for Gehenna.
[Mika]: But Arius vehemently opposed the union...and that feud ultimately led to conflict.
[Mika]: Trinity suppressed Arius following the unification. It simply couldn't withstand the combined might of the new academy.
[Mika]: Such stories are commonplace in history. Those who hold great power tend to want to test it, and Arius made for a suitable target.
[Mika]: Arius Academy fell to ruin.
[Mika]: It was banished from the Trinity district, but rumors say its doors remain open, hiding somewhere in the underbelly of Kivotos.
[Mika]: They've kept the location of their district a secret to avoid Trinity's watchful eye. Even the General Student Council doesn't know where Arius operates from currently.
[Mika]: It wouldn't surprise me if those that know the story thought of it as nothing but an urban legend. How could such an academy truly exist? Then again, I think most of our students are completely unaware of the tale.
[Mika]: That's the Arius Academy of today. A shadow forgotten to history.
[Sensei]: "And you're saying that's where Azusa is from?"
[Mika]: Correct.
[Mika]: You said the story sounded familiar. As you suspect, the Eden Treaty that Nagi is proposing now is an homage to the First Council.
[Mika]: This is a chance for two great academies to reconcile and come together in peace.
[Mika]: If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. The real objective is to found the Eden Treaty Organization, or ETO.
[Mika]: The Eden Treaty is anything but a peace signing—it's the start of a formal military alliance.
[Mika]: Mika steps forward
[Mika]: Its true purpose is to create a single armed organization using the combined forces of Trinity and Gehenna.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: Enter Nagisa
[Mika]: These are uncertain times we're living in—the General Student Council president is still missing. Now, from the shadows, rises a new overwhelming power.
[Mika]: And what does Nagi intend to do with it, I wonder.
[Mika]: Perhaps attack what remains of the General Student Council and assume control of Kivotos?
[Mika]: Or does she plan to uproot Millennium and stop its sudden emergence as Kivotos' rising new academy?
[Mika]: I can't say what her goal is for certain, but there is one thing I know.
[Mika]: Power that immense can be used to silence any and all dissenters.
[Mika]: Just as Trinity did to Arius long ago.
[Mika]: Or just like Seia…
[Mika]: !!!
[Mika]: Uh, sorry. Pretend you didn't hear that.
[Sensei]: "Has something happened to Seia?"
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: She's...ill. Just as I told you.
[Sensei]: "Then where is she?"
[Mika]: Hmm.
[Mika]: Do you really want to know?
[Mika]: Telling you would mean crossing a line I could never walk back from.
[Mika]: So if you betrayed me, I truly would be completely abandoned.
[Mika]: Do you still want to know?
[Sensei]: "Betray you?"
[Mika]: Yes, but I'm sure it will be fine. You said you're on my side, didn't you?
[Mika]: If someone who said that went on to betray me, then...maybe I wouldn't mind so much. Heeehee.
[Mika]: The truth is that Seia isn't fighting illness.
[Mika]: Mika walks closer
[Mika]: Her halo was destroyed.
[Sensei]: “...?!”
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: I know. It's too horrible to be true, but it is.
[Mika]: And it's been covered up since last year. Seia was attacked by an unknown assailant.
[Mika]: Her illness is nothing but a facade—Seia's dead.
[Mika]: And no one knows but the Tea Party.
[Mika]: Well, it's possible the Sisterhood may be aware... Their intelligence-gathering has always been remarkable.
[Mika]: Regardless, it's a secret that must be kept hidden.
[Sensei]: "And no one knows who is responsible?"
[Mika]: Mika (Tea Party):  confidential information, so I'm sure that only makes it harder to narrow down the suspects.
[Mika]: So there you have it.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: Personally, I have my own list of suspects, but it wouldn't be wise to share it without knowing for sure.
[Mika]: Let's get back to talking about Shirasu Azusa.
[Mika]: I was the one who arranged to have her transferred to Trinity.
[Sensei]: "You did, Mika?"
[Mika]: Uh-huh. I kept it a secret from Nagi. I registered Azusa as a student returning from break after falsifying her documents.
[Mika]: You're probably wondering why.
[Mika]: Arius still hates us, after all.
[Mika]: While our students take the privileged environment around them for granted, their students scrape by under impoverished conditions, not knowing what it truly means to receive an education.
[Mika]: They stubbornly cling to a grudge from years past and reject the help of anyone, including the General Student Council.
[Mika]: We would reconcile with Arius if it were up to me.
[Mika]: But the hatred for each other is too great, and the misunderstandings too many. It's not a relationship I could ever hope to reconcile on my own.
[Mika]: Nagi and Seia objected to my opinions for political reasons, butI never held it against them. That's the essence of what the Tea Party does.
[Mika]: I'm not the best when it comes to politics, actually... I wish we could all simply get along.
[Mika]: If only we could reconcile our misunderstandings over tea like in the past.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: What I really want is for Azusa to become a symbol of peace.
[Mika]: I don't know her very well, but she was supposedly an outstanding student at Arius, and I want to foster her potential.
[Mika]: Maybe I should have been more honest and tried to convince Nagi through the proper channels...but I had my doubts it was possible.
[Mika]: I don't think she ever would have agreed to it.
[Mika]: Reconciling with Arius will become impossible if the Eden Treaty is signed. I wanted to make amends before that happened at any cost.
[Mika]: I want to show through Azusa that an Arius student can be happy and accepted at Trinity.
[Mika]: But now Nagi has introduced the rumor of there being a traitor attending Trinity.
[Mika]: I don't know how she came to that conclusion. Maybe it's all my fault.
[Mika]: She became so paranoid that someone was interfering with her plans that she decided to form the Make-Up Work Club.
[Mika]: Speaking of which, have you figured out why each student was forced to join?
[Mika]: It's because Nagi suspects every one of them.
[Mika]: Enter Hanako
[Mika]: Hanako is a little eccentric, but she was an outstanding student with excellent grades. She was even a candidate to join the Tea Party once.
[Mika]: The Sisterhood tried to recruit her as well, but that didn't work out.
[Mika]: Hanako in a swimsuit smiling at Hinata
[Mika]: She attended a chapel class in nothing but a swimsuit and was dragged out by the Sisters. You should have seen the shock on people's faces. Hahaha.
[Mika]: Enter silhouette of Hanako
[Mika]: Hanako had so much potential in her first year, but then she began scoring the lowest grades in her class at the start of her second year.
[Mika]: Why? Was she doing it on purpose?
[Mika]: She had already made inroads around Trinity and was aware of several academy secrets before her scores began tanking.
[Mika]: It drew Nagi's suspicion.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: Enter Koharu
[Mika]: As for Koharu... She's a nice girl that really has nothing to do with politics.
[Mika]: Enter Hasumi
[Mika]: Her enrollment into the Make-Up Work Club has to do with Hasumi.
[Sensei]: “Hasumi?”
[Mika]: Nagi doesn't like there being such a powerful club with someone so influential outside of her direct control.
[Mika]: So Koharu is her insurance policy.
[Mika]: It wouldn't have mattered who it was from theJustice Task Force. Koharu just happened to have the lowest grades, so she was selected.
[Mika]: She's a hostage, in other words, and I bet Hasumi is aware of it. One wrong move could lead to expulsion.
[Sensei]: “But…”
[Mika]: But what? Are you surprised to hear that Hasumi would be considered a dangerous element?
[Mika]: There's one particular incident that may pique your interest, then.
[Mika]: [Justice Task Force Club Room]
[Mika]: Punching and shattering
[Tsurugi]: …
[Mashiro]: …
[Justice Task Force Member A]: V-Vice President Hasumi, please calm down…
[Hasumi]: How dare they?! Pandemonium Society! Gehenna! Do they think they'll get away with this?!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: Ahhhhhh!
[Hasumi]: *pant* *pant*...
[Hasumi]: Listen carefully.
[Hasumi]: This isn't over…
[Mika]: Hasumi is the vice president of theJustice Task Force—Trinity's main armed force—and holds Gehenna in contempt.
[Mika]: She would obviously oppose the Eden Treaty because it would require an alliance with her greatest enemies.
[Mika]: And finally, there's Hifumi.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: Enter Hifumi
[Mika]: She's just a sweet, cute, lovable girl, right? Even Nagi adores her.
[Mika]: But that's also what landed her right in Nagi's crosshairs.
[Mika]: Hifumi was caught sneaking out of the district and visiting suspicious places, such as the prohibited underground Black Market.
[Mika]: There's even intel that connects her to a masked criminal group. Can you believe that? She seemed like such an innocent girl.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: How like Nagi to keep her friends close and her enemies closer. Very predictable.
[Mika]: There you have it. The whole story of how Nagi's paranoia…
[Mika]: ...led to a full-blown conspiracy that a traitor is out to ruin Trinity.
[Mika]: Nagi's absolutely certain that there must be a traitor in their midst.
[Mika]: I know that explanation was a little long-winded, but that is the whole truth.
[Sensei]: "But you said that the traitor is really..."
[Mika]: I did. Think of it this way: How would you define what it means to be a "traitor"?
[Mika]: Nagi is under the assumption that someone is trying to deceive her, and thereby Trinity's Tea Party. She suspects there to be a spy.
[Mika]: In that sense, Azusa, the one whose background is a complete fabrication, is the closest to fitting that description.
[Mika]: Unlike the others, she truly is a transfer from one of Trinity's enemies: Arius.
[Mika]: She's now at the eye of a complex political storm and has no idea that it's all my fault.
[Mika]: That's why I'm fighting to prevent her expulsion.
[Mika]: Or at least, that's what I'm attempting to do by pleading my case to you. I want you to prevent her from being expelled. That's something a sensei can do, right?
[Mika]: In other words, you could argue that I'm the real traitor. I'm the one who's opposing Nagi's Eden Treaty.
[Mika]: But since I'm the host, I don't have any real power and have no means to prevent it.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: Then again, maybe that's not the truth either.
[Mika]: You could just as easily argue that if anyone is betraying Trinity…
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: Enter Nagisa
[Mika]: ...it would be Nagi.
[Mika]: She's attempting to transform Trinity and all the values, harmony, and unity it's enjoyed into something else. She wants to awaken a Leviathan.
[Mika]: That's my take on things. Whether you believe or agree with anything I've said is completely up to you.
[Mika]: Everything is in your hands now. Whether you'll protect Azusa or weed out the traitor... Whether you'll believe Nagi or myself…
[Sensei]: "Is that everything you wanted to say?"
[Mika]: Pretty much. I'm responsible for Azusa enrolling at our academy, but this is as much as I can do to help her.
[Mika]: Don't tell me you're worried about me, Sensei.
[Mika]: Hahaha. How very sweet of you. I may fall for you after all.
[Mika]: You don't need to worry about me. I'm much stronger than I appear.
[Mika]: Well then, I should be going. I really enjoyed talking with you today.
[Mika]: People might start spreading salacious rumors if we spend too much time alone together...not that I would mind. Heehee.
[Mika]: Until we meet again, Sensei.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: <I went back to the classroom everyone was studying in after saying goodbye to Mika.>
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 02 - The Sisterhood
[Mika]: Mari makes her way to the Make-Up Work Club to offer thanks on behalf 01; the student that Azusa recently saved. Later, Sensei is waiting to discuss the future with Hifumi when Hanako arrives and the situation takes an unexpected turn.
[Hifumi]: Oh, there you are, Sensei!
[Sensei]: "Sorry I'm late. Something came up."
[Hifumi]: Don't worry about it. More importantly, take a look! They're our latest mock exam scores!
[Sensei]: Check the test results.
[Sensei]: <<Second Make-Up Work Club Mock Exam Results>>
[Hanako]: 8 Points (Fail)
[Azusa]: 58 Points (Fail)
[Koharu]: 49 Points (Fail)
[Hifumi]: 64 Points (Pass)
[Azusa]: Hmm. It was very close.
[Hifumi]: Yeah, you're doing a lot better! Almost there, Azusa!
[Koharu]: H-Hey, she's not the only one who improved. My score went up a lot too.
[Hifumi]: I know! You scored a 15 on your last exam, but now you're up to 49. That's the biggest jump out of all of us!
[Koharu]: Of course I did! I told you I've been holding back all this time.
[Hifumi]: Y-Yeah! Keep it up!
[Hifumi]: U-Um... Hanako?
[Hanako]: Heehee. What's wrong, Hifumi? Why so sheepish?
[Hanako]: I scored a 2 on our first real exam. Then I scored a 4 on our first mock exam. Now I've scored an 8.
[Hanako]: That means I'm steadily doubling my scores each time. At this rate, I just need to take three more tests and I should be passing too, right?
[Hifumi]: Well...I suppose so, technically.
[Sensei]: "You're all doing great."
[Hifumi]: That's right. We'll all be above passing sooner than I thought if we keep this up.
[Azusa]: I will not stop until I complete my mission and win those cute things. No matter the cost.
[Hifumi]: Y-You remember the real goal is to avoid failing, right?! The rewards were just incentives.
[Azusa]: That's now my secondary objective that I don't mind completing along the way.
[Hifumi]: Secondary?! I mean, I respect it as a fellow Momo Friends fan, but still…
[Hifumi]: ding dong
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Hanako]: Seems we have a visitor.
[Hifumi]: Y-Yeah, but who would come all the way here to visit us?
[???]: U-Um... Excuse me!
[Hanako]: Oh. That voice sounds like…
[Azusa]: ...an intruder. Good thing I've taken measures.
[Hifumi]: What are you talking about, Azu—
[Hifumi]: BOOM
[???]: Ahhh!
[Azusa]: I set explosive traps to stop intruders.
[Hifumi]: Azusa…
[???]: How many did you set? I hope there aren't mo—
[???]: Multiple bombs set off
[???]: Ahhh!
[Azusa]: There's nowhere to run. Naturally, I laid traps along an intruder's likely escape route.
[Hifumi]: Azusa!!!
[Hifumi]: [Annex Entrance]
[Hifumi]: Smoke enveloping the area
[Mari]: *cough* *cough*
[Hifumi]: A-Are you okay?! You're not hurt, are you?
[Mari]: May peace and *cough* comfort find you today. *cough*
[Hifumi]: I'm much more worried about your comfort right now!
[Hifumi]: Wait, I know that uniform... Are you from the Sisterhood?
[Hanako]: I thought that sounded like you, Mari.
[Mari]: H-Hanako…
[Koharu]: Here. It's water.
[Mari]: Thank you.
[Mari]: *gulp* *gulp*
[Mari]: Phew. That really caught me off guard. What was that just now?
[Hifumi]: Azusa…
[Hifumi]: !
[Hifumi]: ?
[Hifumi]: Hifumi nudges Azusa towards Mari
[Azusa]: Um…
[Azusa]: I'm sorry. I thought it was an enemy ambush.
[Mari]: M-Me? An enemy?
[Hifumi]: So what brings someone from the Sisterhood here?
[Mari]: Right. About that…
[Mari]: I was told this is where I could find the Make-Up Work Club, but I didn't expect to run into Hanako here.
[Hanako]: It just so happens my grades are terrible.
[Mari]: Oh. So they are…
[Koharu]: You know her?
[Hanako]: Haha. You could say we're acquainted.
[Hanako]: If you're not here for me, then what are you here for?
[Mari]: Right. Of course.
[Mari]: I've been looking for Shirasu Azusa.
[Azusa]: Me?
[Mari]: Yes. There's a student you rescued recently that wanted to reach out to express her gratitude.
[Hifumi]: Rescued?
[Azusa]: Gratitude?
[Mari]: Yes. Azusa helped a student that was being constantly bullied by her classmates. Apparently, she was called to the back of a secluded building and harassed on the day in question.
[Hifumi]: Someone was harassing the poor girl?!
[Koharu]: What?!
[Hanako]: These things happen, sadly. You may not hear about it often, but that's because perpetrators intimidate and coerce their victims into silence.
[Mari]: Thank goodness the student came to us asking for advice.
[Mari]: She told us you rescued her one day when you just happened to be passing by.
[Koharu]: She did?
[Azusa]: I suppose that did happen. I don't enjoy watching gangs prey on the weak.
[Mari]: As I understand it, one of the attackers you suppressed retaliated by reporting you to the Justice Task Force, which escalated to you and the task force engaging in a firefight.
[Koharu]: …?!
[Mari]: At which you point you occupied a tear gas warehouse and held the Justice Task Force off for three whole hours.
[Koharu]: That's how all of that started?!
[Azusa]: I never retreat from a fight. I could have defeated at least three more of your comrades had I not run out of ammunition.
[Hifumi]: You have to be kidding me…
[Mari]: That student came to us wanting to thank you, but after you couldn't be found at the academy...I ended up having to come here.
[Azusa]: So that's it.
[Azusa]: Her gratitude is undeserved. I ended up being captured in the end.
[Hifumi]: I don't think that's what's important…
[Azusa]: But you shouldn't allow yourself to be bullied. Even if everything is meaningless, that is no reason to give up.
[Mari]: Wise words. I'll pass your message along to her.
[Mari]: …
[Mari]: People say that you're nothing but a violent ice queen, but that couldn't be further from the truth after all.
[Mari]: ?
[Azusa]: That's so sweet, but I wouldn't say those rumors are completely unfounded. Azusa is rather rough around the edges.
[Azusa]: !
[Mari]: Hanako…
[Hanako]: Mari. I'm glad to see you're doing well.
[Mari]: I am, however…
[Hanako]: I'll show you the way out. Come on—this way.
[Mari]: Oh. Okay.
[Mari]: I'll be going now. I'm sorry for interrupting, Sensei.
[Sensei]: "Take care."
[Sensei]: <The day's studies came to an end soon after that.>
[Hanako]: Listen up, everyone! Tonight is laundry night!
[Hanako]: Put your uniforms, underwear, socks, and anything else you need to have washed into the basket.
[Azusa]: Sure. Thank you for offering.
[Hifumi]: You want our underwear too?!
[Koharu]: I can wash it myself, thank you very much!
[Azusa]: But doing all of our laundry at once saves water and detergent. Hanako is being efficient. Fall in line. Now.
[Hifumi]: Fine... Here you go.
[Koharu]: *sigh*
[Hanako]: Why thank you. ♥
[Hanako]: What about you, Sensei? Anything you need washed?
[Sensei]: "Thanks, but I'm good."
[Hanako]: Aw, okay. I'm off to the laundry room, then.
[Hanako]: Everything here should be dry by tomorrow morning.
[Azusa]: We should be heading to bed. Good night, everyone.
[Koharu]: ‘Night.
[Koharu]: Hifumi steps closer
[Hifumi]: (Sensei. Can I talk to you later? It's about Hanako.)
[Sensei]: Nod.
[Sensei]: [Sensei’s Room]
[???]: Are you there, Sensei?
[Sensei]: "(That must be Hifumi.)" / Open the door.
[Sensei]: Hanako enters, with her swimsuit
[Hanako]: Hi, Sensei. It's me.
[Hanako]: Door closes
[Sensei]: “...?!”
[Hanako]: That was a lot easier than I was expecting. You really wanted me to come in, didn't you? ♥
[Sensei]: "What are you doing here?!" / "Why are you in your swimsuit?!"
[Hanako]: Why do you sound so uncomfortable? These are just my pajamas.
[Sensei]: "Since when does a swimsuit pass for pajamas?"
[Hanako]: Heehee. You worry too much. Anyway, I have an important reason for coming here.
[Hanako]: I wanted to talk to you.
[Hanako]: Hanako steps closer
[Hanako]: It's about Azusa.
[Sensei]: “Azusa?”
[Sensei]: Knock knock
[Hifumi]: Are you there, Sensei? It's me.
[Hifumi]: Door opens
[Hifumi]: Sorry I took so long. I know I'm here later than last night…
[Hifumi]: Door closes
[Hifumi]: Oh.
[Hanako]: …
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: THUD
[Hifumi]: I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt! I had no idea the two of you were—I mean, how long has this been going on?!
[Hanako]: Hifumi? Did you just say you were in Sensei's room last night too?! How long has THIS been going on?!
[Hifumi]: I-I'm sorry! I never would have imposed had I known! I'll c-come back later, Sensei. Wait, no! I mean, I won't bring the mood down again, so the next time we should talk would be tomorrow and I...! I...!
[Hanako]: Where do you think you're going? Iwant to know what's been going on between you two—all the juicy details. Or better yet, a reenactment would do just fine too.
[Sensei]: "Make it stop... Please make it stop..."
[Sensei]: <We eventually managed to clear up the misunderstanding after several more minutes.>
[Sensei]: <Hifumi yelled at Hanako to go change out of her swimsuit as well.>
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 03 - Secret Society
[Sensei]: Hanako learns from Hifumi that failing will result in all of them getting expelled from school. Deducing that this was Naglsa's aim all along, Hanako declares that she will try harder going forward and is delighted that the three of them have formed a secret society.
[Hanako]: Now I get it. You've been coming here to talk to Sensei about our lesson plans.
[Hifumi]: And you just needed some advice...?
[Hifumi]: But why do you keep calling your swimsuit your pajamas?!
[Hanako]: You're talking to a girl who wore her swimsuit to chapel once. I don't understand why everyone is so uptight about these things.
[Hanako]: .
[Hifumi]: U-Uhhh…
[Sensei]: "You said you wanted to talk to me about Azusa?"
[Hanako]: Yes, that's right.
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: It's okay, Hifumi. You can listen in too.
[Hanako]: The thing is, she's gone out the last two nights and hasn't returned until almost sunrise.
[Hifumi]: Azusa…
[Hanako]: I was under the impression she was simply having trouble sleeping outside of her usual bed at first, but I don't think that's it.
[Hanako]: In fact, I've never actually seen her sleep at all.
[Hifumi]: Come to think of it, neither have I. Azusa is usually the last one asleep, but the first one out of bed…
[Hanako]: I'm not sure what she's up to, but I'm starting to get concerned that we'll have to step in and force her to get some rest for her own good.
[Hanako]: I can't help but feel that she's...anxious about something.
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: It's not my place to pry into her private life, but I think we owe it to her to help. Every girl needs a good night's sleep.
[Hanako]: I'm afraid she's going to end up collapsing sooner or later.
[Hanako]: And the same goes for the two of you. Stop staying up so late, and take better care of yourselves.
[Hanako]: Our club work is important, but it shouldn't take priority over your health. The worst that could happen is the club fails. What's the point of our minds "passing" if our bodies ultimately fail anyway?
[Sensei]: "True..."
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: It's not that simple…
[Hanako]: Hifumi?
[Hifumi]: Failing isn't the worst thing that could happen! If we fail the last two exams…
[Hifumi]: ...we'll be expelled! We'll be forced to leave Trinity!
[Hanako]: Expelled...? What are you talking about?
[Hanako]: They can't expel you that easily. It's a long, complicated process that needs more valid reasoning than simply your grades.
[Sensei]: "She's telling the truth."
[Hanako]: Sensei?
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: Tell her the truth about the Make-Up Work Club.
[Sensei]: Scene change
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: It must be true if that's the case. We're going to be expelled if we don't all pass by the third exam.
[Hanako]: This arrangement and the collective punishment wouldn't be possible normally, but given Schale's extrajudicial authority is involved...it all makes sense.
[Hifumi]: Does it? I don't think it makes sense at all.
[Hifumi]: And that goes for you too! Didn't your grades use to be at the top of the class?! You were earning perfect scores in advanced third-year level classes despite only being a first-year!
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: I...found out while looking at last year's tests when I was putting together our mock exams. I'm sorry for invading your privacy.
[Hifumi]: But why? Why did you choose to begin failing this year? If it keeps up, then the rest of us will be…
[Hanako]: You'll have to forgive me. I never would have imagined that if even one You'll have to forgive me. I never would have imagined that if even one
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: No. I shouldn't have been so naive.
[Hanako]: I owe you each an apology for all the trouble I've caused.
[Hanako]: I'm sorry, Sensei.
[Hanako]: I'm sorry, Hifumi.
[Hifumi]: H-Hanako. It's fine—I already forgive you.
[Hifumi]: Hanako thinks
[Hanako]: It's as you suspected. I've been intentionally scoring low on my exams.
[Hifumi]: But why?! What would compel you to do something like that?
[Hanako]: I'm afraid I can't tell you.
[Hifumi]: …?!
[Hanako]: I have my reasons...but I don't want you all to suffer because of my choices.
[Hanako]: So you don't have to worry. It ends tonight.
[Hanako]: I'll pass my exams and keep the rest of the Make-Up Work Club safe.
[Sensei]: "Thank you, Hanako.”
[Hanako]: You don't have to thank me, Sensei.
[Hanako]: If anything, I should be the one making it up to you. What ifI did a little striptease? Would that suffice?
[Hifumi]: N-No, you've already done plenty! You taking the exams seriously from now on is more than enough.
[Hanako]: Oh, I have a question. Are you two the only ones that know about all of this?
[Hifumi]: I think so. Sensei was the only person I had talked to about it until now.
[Hanako]: If that's the case, then expulsion isn't what's making Azusa anxious. That mystery is still unsolved…
[Hanako]: Actually, I feel as though the Make-Up Work Club's entire founding is even more confusing after what you've told me.
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: I doubt Mika could arrange this. It must have been Nagisa's doing.
[Sensei]: “...!”
[Hanako]: But why now? Why would she busy herself with something like this just days ahead of the Eden Treaty's signing?
[Hanako]: Or is that the exact reason she's doing it?
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: Now I understand. The Make-Up Work Club's purpose is to herd any potential threats to the Eden Treaty.
[Sensei]: “...?!”
[Hifumi]: What?!
[Hanako]: It's a very Nagisa-like thing to do. She can be a real conniving witch when she wants to be.
[Hifumi]: D-Did you just call her a witch?
[Hanako]: Nagisa is trying to wash out every problematic element at once. We're yesterday's dirty laundry, basically.
[Sensei]: "I think she'd equate it more to a trash bin."
[Hanako]: Her plans include you too, don't they, Sensei?
[Hanako]: You probably accepted this job with the good intention of saving failing students, but in reality, you were a pawn for the sake of using Schale's extrajudicial authority.
[Hanako]: And yet that hasn't stopped you from doing everything you can for us.
[Hanako]: You truly are a wonderful person, Sensei. ♥
[Hifumi]: And you're more like a detective, Hanako. I'm amazed.
[Hifumi]: Nagisa told me that she's searching for "Trinity's traitor".
[Hanako]: That's just like Nagisa—so melodramatic. Though I'm sure anyone who disagrees with her plans is a traitor in her mind.
[Hanako]: I can understand why Azusa would be a suspect given her background.
[Hanako]: I could be off-base, but it wouldn't surprise me if Koharu was essentially a hostage from the Justice Task Force.
[Hanako]: But what about you, Hifumi? I thought you were close with Nagisa.
[Hifumi]: Me?! A-Am I really a suspect too?
[Hifumi]: I guess I'd have to be if she placed me here... Wh-What did I ever do to fall under suspicion?
[Sensei]: “...”
[Sensei]: Scene change
[Hanako]: We'll have to talk more about Azusa later. I'll see ifI can't find out more about what's been going on.
[Hifumi]: That'd be great. Please keep us in the loop if you learn anything.
[Hanako]: Sure thing. So? Does this mean I'm officially a part of your secret midnight trysts?
[Hanako]: The three of us, all alone late at night sharing a heart-pounding ménage à trois! ♥
[Hifumi]: That's not what's happening!
[Sensei]: "It IS pretty late. Let's call it for tonight."
[Hifumi]: You're right. We should be getting to bed.
[Hanako]: Good night.
[Koharu]: Hngh... Bathroom…
[Koharu]: Is that light coming from Sensei's room? What are they still doing up at this hour?
[Koharu]: Door opens
[Hifumi]: I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sens—huh?
[Koharu]: …?!
[Koharu]: Wh-What were you doing in Sensei's room?!
[Hanako]: Bye, Sensei. I'm looking forward to tomorrow night's ménage a trois!
[Hanako]: Oh?
[Koharu]: …
[Koharu]: Koharu fucking kills them
[Koharu]: Black screen
[Koharu]: Athreesome?! Lewd! Filthy! Execuuution!
[Koharu]: <It was the end of yet another day at boot camp.>
[Koharu]: <<To be Continued>>
[Koharu]: 04 - Swimsuit Symposium
[Koharu]: Rain drenches the Make-Up Work Club's laundry and they have no choice but to take a day off from studying and hold a swimsuit symposium instead. After experiencing their first enjoyable day in a while, they all decide to go out together on a nighttime walk.
[Koharu]: Raining noises
[Hifumi]: It's really coming down.
[Hanako]: It certainly is.
[Koharu]: Hngh... Good morning.
[Hanako]: Good morning, Koharu!
[Hifumi]: Morning. It looks like Azusa is the last one to get up today.
[Azusa]: Hmm.... Mmm…
[Koharu]: What happened? She's usually the first one awake.
[Hanako]: I think she's been pushing herself too hard these last few days. We should let her sleep in a little while longer.
[Azusa]: Hmm...no. The cute creatures... So round and fluffy... I mustn't.
[Hanako]: Someone sounds like they're having a good dream. ♥
[Sensei]: "There's nothing like sleeping in on a rainy day."
[Sensei]: Lighting flash and thunder
[Hifumi]: Th-The sound of thunder might make it hard, though.
[Hanako]: Uh-oh.
[Koharu]: What's wrong?
[Hanako]: The laundry I hung out to dry last night! I completely forgot about it!
[Hanako]: ?!
[Hanako]: Hanako whisks away
[Hifumi]: This is bad!
[Hifumi]: Hifumi and Koharu whisk away
[Hifumi]: Azusa gets up
[Azusa]: Hmm?
[Azusa]: Azusa walks around
[Azusa]: ?
[Azusa]: Azusa walks away
[Azusa]: Fade to black
[Azusa]: <One hour later.>
[Hanako]: Now, then. Let's begin the first Make-Up Work Club Swimsuit Symposium! ♥
[Hifumi]: I don't know about this…
[Azusa]: Hmm.
[Koharu]: Why did it have to come to this...?
[Koharu]: THUNDER!
[Sensei]: "We are in uncharted waters."
[Hanako]: And perfectly dressed for the occasion, I might add. ♥
[Hanako]: Thunder crash
[Hanako]: Fade to black
[Hanako]: <40 minutes earlier.>
[Azusa]: That's all of it.
[Hanako]: They're completely soaked. Not to mention muddled. Our only choice is to put all of them through the wash again.
[Koharu]: Even our gym clothes are wet now! They're sticking to me like they're covered in glue.
[Azusa]: That's because you tripped and got all of us soaked.
[Hanako]: No, this is my fault. I'm the one who offered to do the laundry and then forgot about it.
[Azusa]: You don't have to blame yourself. We can always re-do the laundry and wear something different in the meantime.
[Hifumi]: That's right. First, let's change into something dry and warm. We're going to catch colds if we keep wearing these.
[Hanako]: And for good measure, let's all take a hot shower together and dry each other's hair afterward.
[Koharu]: …!
[Hifumi]: Is something wrong?
[Koharu]: I'm...out of clean clothes to wear.
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Azusa]: So am I. My uniform and gym clothes are soaked, and I don't have a spare change of clothes.
[Hifumi]: You too? Wait! Neither do I…
[Hanako]: Isn't this a fun turn of events? I guess we'll just have to study in our bras and panties today, ladies. ♥
[Koharu]: In your dreams, you perv! We're not gonna do something like that!
[Azusa]: She has a point. We all have plenty of fresh underwear, and we can wear socks to help keep us warm.
[Koharu]: Don't go along with her madness! We can't just wear our underwear to class!
[Hanako]: Why not? You have no imagination—
[Koharu]: Not another word!!!
[Koharu]: Sigh
[Koharu]: We'll just have to do the laundry as quickly as we can and dry some of it with a hairdryer or something!
[Koharu]: In the meantime, we'll just have to make do with wearing towels! And Sensei can wait for us down the hall!
[Koharu]: We can put off studying for at least a few hours. Why are you so eager to hit the books all of a sudden?
[Hanako]: I suppose, but we're still going to be stuck in our underwear for a few hours.
[Azusa]: I'd have preferred to begin studying as soon as possible, but I suppose we can't enter the classroom just yet. All we can do is take these off for now.
[Hifumi]: *sigh*...
[Koharu]: Why are you all so disappointed about not getting to study in your underwear?! Do you want to be executed for indecent exposure?!
[Koharu]: [Sensei’s room]
[Koharu]: <I decided to stay in my room until the laundry was done.>
[Koharu]: Thunder crash
[Koharu]: Lights go out
[Koharu]: Ahhh! What happened?!
[Hifumi]: I think the power went out.
[Hanako]: Seems like it. It must be because of the thunderstorm.
[Hanako]: THUD
[Hifumi]: Wh-What was that sound?!
[Azusa]: We have a problem.
[Azusa]: That was the washing machine stopping. And it's locked. What do we do?
[Koharu]: …?!
[Koharu]: Lightning flash
[Sensei]: "So that's how we came to the last resort."
[Hanako]: Sure did. Our only choice is to hold a swimsuit symposium. ♥
[Hifumi]: *sigh* There must be another way…
[Hanako]: I guess you're right. We could always have an underwear symposium instead. I wouldn't mind that at all. ♥
[Azusa]: It will be difficult to hold class under these conditions. Not to mention all of the building's facilities have shut down due to the lightning. Our defenses are wide open.
[Hifumi]: W-Well, this kind of thing happens to old buildings in thunderstorms.
[Koharu]: Who cares about that?! Why are you all going along with this ridiculous symposium anyway?!
[Koharu]: I thought we agreed that we can't have class if we don't have any clothes to wear! Shouldn't we just go back to the dorm and rest until the blackout passes?!
[Hanako]: But what kind of camp would this be if we passed on the opportunity to make memories?
[Hanako]: This is our chance to share the most intimate parts of ourselves. A sudden blackout, driving rain... The mood is perfect!
[Hanako]: We may as well indulge while we have the chance. You only live once. ♥
[Hifumi]: I-I'm not denying that making memories is part of any good camp…
[Azusa]: I see. So that's the purpose of a swimsuit symposium.
[Koharu]: No it isn't! There's nothing educational about wearing swimsuits to class!
[Hifumi]: U-Uhhh…
[Hanako]: Now, now. There's no need to raise your voice, Koharu. Let's just go with the flow and have some fun while we can.
[Hanako]: Calling it a symposium was just to keep up appearances. We can talk about anything we want. Nothing is off limits. ♥
[Hanako]: I've always wanted to do something like this. I've never been happier to have joined the Make-Up Work Club. ♥
[Sensei]: "You look like you're having the time of your life."
[Azusa]: I can sympathize. I too am happy to have joined the club.
[Hanako]: You are?
[Azusa]: Of course I am. I enjoy getting to study, eat, and even clean and do laundry with all of you. Not a single activity hasn't been enjoyable.
[Hanako]: Aw, that's so sweet.
[Azusa]: I've always thought swimsuits were merely meant for swimming, but now I'm learning all sorts of other useful applications for them.
[Hifumi]: That sounds more like corruption than enjoyment…
[Azusa]: But they're comfortable to move around in and breathable. I can understand why Hanako is so fond of hers.
[Hanako]: You've finally seen the light. See? I told you, Koharu.
[Koharu]: Public indecency is still a crime punishable by death! That's all you need to know!
[Azusa]: I enjoy studying with you too, Koharu.
[Koharu]: Wh-Where's this coming from all of a sudden?! Don't just blurt out embarrassing things like that!
[Hanako]: That's even sweeter! ♥
[Koharu]: W-Well, of course you should relish the opportunity to study with an elite like myself.
[Azusa]: Hmm.               glimmer
[Hifumi]: I could never get a good read on you when we first met, but it's a relief to hear you've been enjoying yourself.
[Hifumi]: !
[Azusa]: Of course. And I'm especially grateful for how you've always taken care of me, Hifumi. Thank you.
[Azusa]: Hifumi shocked
[Azusa]: Black screen
[Hifumi]: Azusaaa! Come give me a hug!
[Hifumi]: ?
[Hifumi]: Azusa gets assaulted
[Hifumi]: <*squeeze*>
[Azusa]: Hifumi. I can't breathe.
[Azusa]: <The Make-Up Work Club continued to pass the time by making small talk.>
[Hanako]: I heard a rare Gold Maguro is on display at the Trinity aquarium right now.
[Hifumi]: I saw it on a pamphlet! That's the one they're calling the fantasy fish, right?
[Hanako]: Yeah. Apparently, it was discovered at the nearby beach. I wanted to go see it for myself, but the admission fee is so high.
[Azusa]: The beach... Now that you mention it, I've never been there before.
[Hifumi]: You've never been to the beach, Azusa?!
[Hanako]: I also heard that you can hear strange noises coming from that long-abandoned theme park.
[Koharu]: Th-That can't be true! That's just an urban legend!
[Hanako]: I've only heard rumors myself, so I can't say for sure...but isn't that how all scary stories go?
[Koharu]: Yeah, and they're all made up!
[Hifumi]: H-Haha…
[Hanako]: I don't find walking about campus or the district in a swimsuit to be strange at all.
[Koharu]: Of course it is! Do you not have a lick of common sense?!
[Hanako]: That reminds me. I heard from a Sister once that somewhere in a lawless area of Kivotos is a gang that wears nothing but bikinis and masks.
[Koharu]: Wh-Why would they only wear that?!
[Koharu]: And you just said they're a gang, so that makes them criminals! Of course criminals have no problem committing public indecency!
[Hanako]: It goes to show just how common wearing nothing but a swimsuit is. Why don't you join me next time?
[Koharu]: No! I don't care what you have in mind—count me out!
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: Scene change
[Hanako]: You need to start getting a better night's sleep, Azusa!
[Azusa]: I know. I'm sorry for inconveniencing you all by oversleeping this morning.
[Azusa]: That never happens in a place where I'm uncomfortable.
[Azusa]: Maybe I overslept because I no longer find that to be the case…
[Hanako]: That doesn't change the fact that you need to get more rest. You need to go on fewer of those late night patrols of yours!
[Koharu]: You've been going on patrols?
[Azusa]: Yes. I've been keeping watch every night…
[Sensei]: "Hanako has been really worried about you."
[Azusa]: She has?
[Azusa]: I didn't realize. I'm sorry.
[Azusa]: To be honest, I use my patrols as an opportunity to do things like set traps and fortify our defenses.
[Hanako]: Traps?
[Hifumi]: Defenses?
[Hanako]: Why would you go to such lengths?
[Azusa]: Don't worry. I only set them along the routes intruders would likely take. They shouldn't pose a threat to us as we go about our studies.
[Hifumi]: (Then how do you explain what happened to Mari yesterday?)
[Hanako]: You should let us know about these things ahead of time. People will suspect you of wrongdoing if you go around doing things like that on your own.
[Azusa]: I suppose you have a point. I'll be more careful from now on.
[Azusa]: The last thing I want is to cause any harm to the club or Sensei.
[Sensei]: "You're a really kind girl, Azusa."
[Azusa]: H-Huh? Don't treat me like child.
[Azusa]: Besides, that's not how I would describe myself.
[Azusa]: The truth is that everything is meaningless, and vanity is the way of the world.
[Azusa]: There will come a day where I betray everything I've ever known—all of you, my faith, and my own heart.
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: Oh…
[Koharu]: …                        confused
[Koharu]: Lights come back on
[Hifumi]: The power's back.
[Hanako]: It's about time.
[Koharu]: And the rain stopped too! Everything is clear outside!
[Hifumi]: We should restart the laundry and get to drying everything again.
[Azusa]: I suppose this marks the end to the first Make-Up Work Club Swimsuit Symposium. I look forward to the second.
[Koharu]: There's not gonna be a second! This was the first and last!
[Koharu]: Fade to black
[Koharu]: <Everyone decided to take a break after finishing the laundry.>
[Koharu]: <And so another day passed…>
[Koharu]: THUD
[Hanako]: No! Not yet! We can't just let this day go to waste!
[Hifumi]: Wh-What?!
[Hifumi]: ?
[Koharu]: Who are you talking to? Don't just start shouting out of nowhere like that. You almost gave me a heart attack.
[Hanako]: Let's just look at today as an unplanned vacation day. We even got to bond together buck naked like real sisters.
[Koharu]: That never happened! Stop revising history!
[Hanako]: But wouldn't it feel like a waste to go to bed so soon? Don't you just want to seize the night and go out with a bang?
[Azusa]: What do you have in mind?
[Hanako]: Isn't it obvious? What kind of camp would this be if we didn't try to sneak out at night at least once. ♥
[Hifumi]: You want to sneak out?
[Hanako]: Obviously. Let's leave the academy behind and go on a walk together!
[Hanako]: There are plenty of places in the Trinity shopping district that are open late. Let's go grab some food and do a little shopping!
[Koharu]: Th-That would be a violation. I can't do that!
[Hanako]: You know the school rules better than I do, butI bet a bunch of students sneak out and go places they shouldn't. Isn't that right, Hifumi?
[Hifumi]: H-Hahaha... Wh-Who knows? Maybe…
[Hifumi]: But Koharu's right. We're in the middle of a mandatory boot camp. There could be dire consequences if we were caught sneaking out now.
[Hanako]: It's not like we'd go that far—it's still within the district. We'll be back before you know it. So what do you say, Koharu? Doesn't it sound fun?
[Koharu]: I-I mean, sure it does, but…
[Hanako]: Come on! One little walk isn't going to kill you. Isn't that right, Sensei?
[Sensei]: "I'm in. Let's do this."
[Koharu]: You're fine with this?!
[Azusa]: I'm dressed and ready.Just give the order on when to move.
[Hifumi]: You too, Azusa?! When did you get changed?
[Hanako]: It's decided. ♥
[Hanako]: Everyone hurry up, and take it off! The Make-Up Work Club is going late-night streaking!
[Koharu]: You said we were going on a walk! Keep your clothes on!
[Koharu]: Fade to black
[Koharu]: <And that's how we decided to go on a late night stroll.>
[Koharu]: <<To be Continued>>
[Koharu]: 05 - Midnight Commotion Part 1
[Koharu]: The Make-Up Work Club runs into Hasumi at a dessert shop during their nighttime walk. Hasumi suggests keeping the encounter a secret due to each other's circumstances, but then receives a call that the Gourmet Research Society is causing a disturbance.
[Hanako]: Heeheehee. ♥
[Hifumi]: Well…here we are.
[Hanako]: See? Isn't this fun? There's nothing like the guilty pleasure of doing something you're not supposed to, mixed with the elation of doing it with others.
[Azusa]: So this is what the district is like at this hour. It's much more vibrant than I expected.
[Hanako]: That's right. A lot of stores stay open 24 hours a day.
[Azusa]: That bakery is still open? And that cafe over there too…
[Hifumi]: A little further up the road is a Momo Friends merch store that's fully automated. And across the street from that is a shop that only sells collectibles.
[Hanako]: Well, well. You sure know your way around the neighborhood.
[Hifumi]: A-Ahaha…
[Koharu]: Ugh. Why did I have to tag along? I'll be in for a world of hurt if Hasumi catches me out here.
[Hanako]: Really? She must be pretty strict with you newbies. I always thought she seemed like a kind girl.
[Koharu]: Th-That's because she is! Hasumi is kind, intelligent, strong, and carries herself with dignity and grace!
[Koharu]: Her temper is...just as peerless as her other aspects.
[Sensei]: "She doesn't get mad often, but when she does... Right?"
[Koharu]: Yeah. There was that one time…
[Koharu]: Flashback
[Koharu]: [JTF Club Room]
[Koharu]: Punching and ceramic breaking
[Tsurugi]: …
[Mashiro]: …
[Justice Task Force Member A]: V-Vice President Hasumi, please calm down…
[Hasumi]: How dare they?! Pandemonium Society! Gehenna! Do they think they'll get away with this?!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: Ahhhhhh!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: Present
[Hanako]: Goodness. What caused her to be so upset?
[Koharu]: She was returning from a meeting with Gehenna's leaders about the Eden Treaty when suddenly…
[Koharu]: Flashback
[Hasumi]: *pant* *pant*...
[Hasumi]: Listen carefully.
[Hasumi]: This isn't over…
[Hasumi]: From this point on, I'll be going on a diet!
[Mashiro]: …?!
[Tsurugi]: …?!
[Justice Task Force Member A]: Did you say...diet?
[Hasumi]: Yes, a diet! I'm going to lose weight!
[Hasumi]: From this moment on, if you catch me eating more than two meals a day or snacking, you have every right to slap the food out of my hand and give me a piece of your mind!
[Hasumi]: Dieting can be hard if you're doing it by yourself, so that's why I'm allowing you all to keep me accountable. I need your help!
[Justice Task Force Member B]: Wh-What exactly happened in that meeting with Gehenna...?
[Hasumi]: …
[Hasumi]: That little... She went way over the line!
[Hasumi]: Flashback within a flashback
[Makoto]: So you must be the one they call Trinity's secret weapon, Kenzaki Tsurugi.
[Hasumi]: Pardon? No, I'm…
[Makoto]: You're much more of a woman than I was expecting. Almost offensively so.
[Makoto]: Heh heh! So, that's how Trinity wants to play it, eh? Trying to break our morale at the start of our first meeting?! How shallow!
[Hasumi]: Huh?
[Makoto]: Iroha! Go get Satsuki. I won't allow Trinity to look down upon us!
[Iroha]: Makoto, this isn't President Tsurugi—this is their vice president, Hasumi. I told you she'd be coming in the documentation I handed you.
[Iroha]: And if you're referring to her bust, then I don't know what good bringing Satsuki here will do.
[Iroha]: …
[Makoto]: WH-WHAT?! They sent a stand-in?! How insulting! Are they mocking us?!
[Makoto]: We've been had! This meeting is nothing but a ploy! Did they only wish to demoralize us with their tall heights and large busts?!
[Iroha]: No, this is why I tried to inform you that we were expecting Hasumi. Are you even listening to me? You're not, are you?
[Makoto]: How DARE you underestimate me! Do you think you can intimidate me with your unflatteringly large chest?!
[Iroha]: Please calm down. And please stop mentioning her bust. You're embarrassing the Pandemonium Society.
[Makoto]: I refuse to surrender to this giantess, Iroha. Prepare you-know-what!
[Makoto]: THUD
[Hasumi]: Giant...?
[Iroha]: I don't know what you're talking about, but I think it's safe to say that the meeting is a failure. I advise that we secure an escape route.
[Makoto]: Huh?
[Makoto]: Rumble
[Makoto]: Black screen
[Hasumi]: AHHHHHH!!!
[Hasumi]: Sounds of punching and breaking
[Hasumi]: Present
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: “...”
[Koharu]: I heard Hasumi hasn't been eating very well ever since that meeting went south.
[Hanako]: No wonder she holds a grudge against Gehenna.
[Sensei]: "Now I'm worried about her too."
[Koharu]: Hasumi is a strong person, though! She's still keeping the vow she made, even after all she went through.
[Koharu]: I'm sure she'll be all right.
[Azusa]: Look. There's another bakery here too.
[Hanako]: My sweet tooth is starting to get a craving after that story. Should we pop in and see what they have?
[Hifumi]: Oh, the special parfaits they have here are amazing! I didn't know they stayed open 24 hours a day…
[Azusa]: Parfait? That sounds perfect. Let's go.
[Azusa]: MUWC walks off
[Koharu]: Wh-Why the rush?!
[Koharu]: Um... I hope nobody sees me here.
[Koharu]: Koharu whisks away
[Clerk]: Welcome.
[Hifumi]: Wow, we're really out in the middle of the night getting dessert. This is so exciting!
[Azusa]: Hmm.
[Clerk]: Party of five? What can I get for you?
[Hifumi]: Um...do you still have that special parfait on the menu?
[Clerk]: I'm sorry. We do, but we just sold the final three we had tonight to our last customer.
[Hifumi]: Oh, that's too bad…
[Azusa]: Beat to the punch. I didn't expect such fierce competition at this hour. How naive of me.
[Azusa]: Black screen
[???]: Oh?
[Hasumi]: S-Sensei?
[Sensei]: “Hasumi?!”
[Koharu]: H-Hasumi?!
[Hanako]: Those wouldn't happen to be parfaits you're carrying, are they?
[Hanako]: Fade to black
[Hanako]: <Hasumi was in fact holding three special parfaits.>
[Hasumi]: I didn't expect to run into the Make-Up Work Club and Sensei here.
[Koharu]: Uh-oh…
[Hanako]: Fancy meeting you here, Hasumi. I'm even more surprised to see you eating three parfaits. Aren't you on a diet?
[Hasumi]: Y-Yes. About that…
[Hanako]: Let me guess. You had a craving you just couldn't curb, so you came all the way here for some of your favorite desserts.
[Hasumi]: N-No! I-I mean…
[Hanako]: You gave in to your delectable desires and before you knew it, it was too late. There was no turning back.
[Sensei]: “I can’t say I blame you.”
[Hasumi]: Sensei. I don't believe the Make-Up Work Club is permitted to leave the school grounds during boot camp.
[Hasumi]: ?!
[Hasumi]: So if you'll keep my secret, then I'll keep yours.
[Koharu]: H-Hasumi…
[Hasumi]: How are your studies going, Koharu?
[Koharu]: Well, um…
[Sensei]: “Her scores keep going up.”
[Hifumi]: That's right! Koharu will be passing in no time at this rate.
[Hasumi]: You don't say?
[Koharu]: Uh…
[Hasumi]: That's good to hear. I told you you could do it.
[Hasumi]: Don't you remember?
[Hasumi]: Flashback
[Hasumi]: Please keep studying hard, Koharu.
[Hasumi]: Don't lose sight of your goal.
[Koharu]: But I don't think I can do it…
[Koharu]: How am I supposed to cram all of this in and get my grades up? I'm not cut out for this…
[Hasumi]: There's no other choice! It must be done!
[Hasumi]: ?!
[Hasumi]: Forgive me for raising my voice, but the only way you'll be able to stay with us is by passing your exams.
[Hasumi]: If not for me, then do it for Sensei and all the effort that's been made to help us. Okay?
[Koharu]: All right. I'll try.
[Koharu]: Present
[Koharu]: Heehee. I wouldn't want to let you down, Hasumi.
[Hasumi]: And I'm always rooting for you. I look forward to you returning to the Justice Task Force soon and joining us on our missions.
[Koharu]: It's a promise!
[Sensei]: “So pure.”
[Sensei]: <*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*>
[Hasumi]: Encrypted communication? At this hour?
[Hasumi]: Yes, Ichika? What's going on?
[Ichika]: We have a problem, Hasumi. What's your location?
[Hasumi]: A problem? Please explain.
[Ichika]: Students presumed to be from Gehenna are trespassing near the academy. They've opened fire and are attacking Trinity facilities.
[Hasumi]: Is it the Gehenna Prefect Team? So, they've finally played their hand. Those Pandemonium Society scum!
[Ichika]: Well, the thing is…
[Hasumi]: They must be trying to interfere with the Eden Treaty! What's the size of their forces? How many squadrons, and what facilities have they targeted?!
[Ichika]: Calm down. First of all, it's not the Prefect Team, and there are zero squadrons. There's only four of them.
[Hasumi]: Just four...? And it's not the Prefect Team?
[Ichika]: Yes. The attacked facility has been confirmed as...the nearby aquarium.
[Hasumi]: Why would they attack there?
[Ichika]: They've stolen the Gold Maguro, a rare fish that was on display, and are now on the run.
[Hasumi]: The Gold Maguro?
[Ichika]: It's said to be a very expensive fish, so they may aim to sell it. We just confirmed this organization's identity.
[Ichika]: The Gourmet Research Society, a terrorist group from Gehenna.
[Ichika]: Fade to black
[Ichika]: Enter Haruna
[Ichika]: Their leader is Kurodate Haruna, someone considered very dangerous by Gehenna! Please hurry and give us your orders, Vice President!
[Junko]: Hey! Why the heck did we decide to hit a place like this?! We're in the middle of Trinity's district!
[Akari]: What other choice did we have? This was the only place to secure the Gold Maguro after all! ★
[Haruna]: How could they keep a legendary tuna fish under lock and key, only to be admired through a fish tank? Have they no respect for the gourmet?
[Haruna]: Fine food is something more noble and ubiquitous.
[Haruna]: The Gold Maguro wouldn't want to be on displayjust to make the rich richer.
[Haruna]: We're merely doing what must be done! Isn't that right, Fuuka?
[Fuuka]: Hnnngh! Hnnnnnngh!
[Haruna]: See? The School Lunch Club president agrees so vehemently that she's been moved to tears.
[Akari]: I think that has more to do with the gag in her mouth. ★
[Izumi]: The tuna keeps flapping around! It's hitting me with its fins!
[Junko]: Don't you dare drop that fish, Izumi! It's priceless!
[Izumi]: Can't we just eat it already?! It's hard enough to hold on to it but now we have those girls in black sailor uniforms chasing us!
[Izumi]: .
[Junko]: That's the TrinityJustice Task Force! They're just as scary as the Prefect Team. How are we gonna get out of here, Haruna?
[Haruna]: Whether we escape or not isn't important.
[Haruna]: The only thing that matters is who has the last bite!
[Haruna]: That is our club's motto: Eat or Die! It's the dignified path all gourmands must accept!
[Akari]: And that's all that matters! ★
[Akari]: Gunfire
[Junko]: We're a lot closer to dying than eating, so get a move on!
[Haruna]: Let us break through this siege and make our retreat! Then we'll have our dearest Fuuka here prepare her famous sashimi for us!
[Fuuka]: Hnnngh! Hnnnnnngh!
[Fuuka]: <To be Continued>
[Fuuka]: 06 - Midnight Commotion Part 2
[Fuuka]: Hasumi asks the Make-Up Work Club and Sensei for help, fearing conflict between Gehenna and Trinity might pose a problem for the Eden Treaty. The entire group heads out together to prevent the worst from happening.
[Hasumi]: The Gourmet Research Society?
[Ichika]: What's your location, Vice President? Please issue orders before President Tsurugi...takes matters into her own hands.
[Hasumi]: Please do what you can to contain her for now. I'm...in the middle of a personal matter at the moment.
[Ichika]: I'm not sure that will be possible. You're the only one she listens to when she gets like this.
[Ichika]: Ah, President Tsurugi! Don't go yet! That's not a door—it's a wall!
[Ichika]: Breaking and exploding
[Ichika]: ...She's gone. Let's mobilize.
[Ichika]: <*click*>
[Hasumi]: …
[Hasumi]: Distant explosion
[Azusa]: They're close by. Within a kilometer, judging by the sound of the explosion.
[Hifumi]: You're not thinking what I think you are...are you?
[Hasumi]: What a coincidence. I had the same thought.
[Hasumi]: I know this is sudden, but your help would be appreciated. Can you do it?
[Hasumi]: This is a delicate situation with the Eden Treaty fast approaching. The last thing we need is an interdistrict incident between the Justice Task Force and Gehenna Academy.
[Hasumi]: I'm formally requesting the Make-Up Work Club's assistance via Schale. Can you do it, Sensei?
[Sensei]: "Of course. Prepare to mobilize, Make-Up Work Club."
[Azusa]: Understood. That won't be a problem.
[Hifumi]: A-Are we really doing this?
[Hanako]: If that's what you want, Sensei. ♥
[Koharu]: I'm going to fight alongside Hasumi...?
[Hasumi]: Of course. I knew this day would come, even if it is sooner than expected.
[Koharu]: O-Okay! I'll do my best!
[Azusa]: This is the first time we'll be fighting as a club under Sensei's command. Please use us as you see fit.
[Hanako]: That's even sweeter! ♥
[Sensei]: “Let’s go, everyone!”
[Sensei]: <Battle Sequence>
[Sensei]: Sensei and the Make—Up Work Club succeed in stopping the Gourmet Research Society's mischief, but each of their members flee, leaving the Justice Task Force hot on their heels in pursuit.
[Izumi]: Noooooo! The tuna!
[Haruna]: I was craving sashimi, but now tempura is on the menu.
[Akari]: So what should we do now? Looks like we're surrounded. ★
[Junko]: Scatter! It's every girl for herself!
[Junko]: Junko whisks away
[Akari]: Good thinking—they can't catch all of us. Survival of the fittest it is!
[Akari]: Akari whisks away
[Haruna]: It comes down to luck now, but I don't mind spicing things up. So long!
[Haruna]: Haruna whisks away
[Izumi]: W-Wait! Don't just leave me here!
[Izumi]: Izumi trips and falls
[Izumi]: *sob* I swear, I'll get all three of you back for this if it's the last thing I do!
[Izumi]: Izumi gets up and whisks away
[Hasumi]: Those pests! Split up and chase each of them!
[Justice Task Force Member]: Yes!
[Hasumi]: This is our district! There's nowhere to run!
[Junko]: *pant* *pant*
[Junko]: I think I lost 'em.
[Junko]: Akari appears, with a dark figure behind
[Junko]: Um…
[Akari]: S-Say, Junko…
[Junko]: Akari?! Why are you here? What happened to you?!
[Akari]: Let's just say...I messed up. ★
[Akari]: Akari falls
[Junko]: A-Akari!
[Junko]: The dark figure slowly approaches
[Tsurugi]: Heh heh heh... Keheheheh…
[Junko]: Wh-What is that?! A m-monster?!
[Tsurugi]: Ahhhhhh!
[Junko]: I don't wanna die!!!
[Junko]: Junko fucking dies in an explosion
[Junko]: <<To be Continued>>
[Junko]: 07 - A New Perspective
[Junko]: The Prefect Team's Hina and the Medical Emergency Club's Sena arrive to handle the Gourmet Research Society's new recruits.Sensei asks Hina about her thoughts on the Eden Treaty and listens to her point of view on the situation.
[Junko]: Toss
[Haruna]: Hello, Junko. Good to see you, Akari.
[Junko]: Haruna? You were caught too?
[Haruna]: I'm afraid I didn't even make it ten meters.
[Junko]: …
[Haruna]: It seems as though Izumi was the only one who managed to get away...somehow. At least our sacrifice wasn't in vain.
[Junko]: Since when was I sacrificing myself for that ditz?
[Haruna]: TheJustice Task Force certainly lives up to their reputation. We were foolish to underestimate them.
[Junko]: You're telling me! One of them crushed Akari like a soda can. I thought we were gonna die!
[Junko]: I told you we shouldn't have come all the way here just for some stupid tuna!
[Haruna]: See here,junko. If you saw water gushing out of a tap into an overflowing sink and there was no one around, what would you do?
[Junko]: Enough with the stupid sink metaphor already!
[Junko]: …
[Junko]: What do you think they're gonna do with us?
[Akari]: Probably hand us over to the Prefect Team.
[Junko]: Akari! Don't just rise from the dead like that!
[Akari]: Oh, please. I was just taking a little nap. It'll take more than that to kill me. ★
[Junko]: A-Anyway. Is being handed over to the Prefect Team any better? May as well be delivering us to our executioners…
[Haruna]: That it may be. I'd like to avoid our fate being in Hina's hands if at all possible…
[Akari]: That's what we get for going too far this time. Oh, well.
[Fuuka]: (Why did I get dragged here too? I just wanna go home...)
[Fuuka]: [Trinity District Border]
[Fuuka]: <Meanwhile, Izumi was…>
[Izumi]: *sob* Wh-Where am I?! Where am I supposed to go?!
[Izumi]: Izumi runs away
[Hasumi]: Good work, everyone. We were able to get the situation under control thanks to your help.
[Hifumi]: Th-Thanks. I thought we got caught up in the heat of the moment.
[Azusa]: It was a good learning experience to see how the Justice Task Force's strategizes from up close.
[Koharu]: I-I hope I was helpful.
[Hanako]: So what's going to happen to those students?
[Hasumi]: Normally, we would decide what to do with them. But given the circumstances we're in, we'll have no choice but to defer to Gehenna's Prefect Team.
[Sensei]: "I thought that might be the case."
[Hasumi]: Actually, I have a favor to ask you regarding that matter.
[Sensei]: “Of me? What is it?”
[Hasumi]: I'd like to avoid conflict as much as possible ahead of the Eden Treaty.
[Hasumi]: With that said, would you mind being the one to hand the detainees over when the Prefect Team arrives?
[Hasumi]: It would lessen the political burden for both sides if Schale was the one who officially had them in custody.
[Sensei]: “I can do that.”
[Hasumi]: Thank you, Sensei. I'll step back, then.
[Hasumi]: [Trinity Outskirts Bridge]
[Hasumi]: <I came to the designated spot to hand the Gourmet Research Society over to the Prefect Team.>
[Hasumi]: Sirens and a car stops
[Hasumi]: A student approaches
[Sena]: I'm here. Where are the bodies?
[Sensei]: “Bodies?”
[Sena]: Pardon me. I mean to say "wounded". I confuse the two sometimes.
[Sena]: According to this, I'm here for three freshly wounded and one hostage.
[Sensei]: "Is that a delivery manifest?"
[Sena]: You don't seem to be from the Justice Task Force. Just who are you?
[Sensei]: "And you don't look like you're from the Prefect Team."
[Sensei]: Door opens and footsteps are heard
[???]: That’s [NAME] Sensei, the advisor of Schale.
[???]: Hina appears
[Sensei]: “Hina!”
[Hina]: We meet again, Sensei. What are you doing here?
[Sena]: You're acquainted, Head Prefect?
[Hina]: You could put it that way, yes…
[Hina]: Brief moment skip
[Hina]: So that's it. The prisoners were turned over to Schale to reduce the political burden of the situation.
[Hina]: We had the same thought. That's why, officially, the Medical Emergency Club will be the ones accepting the transfer of custody. I'm merely here to supervise.
[Sena]: Sena. Himuro Sena, Medical Emergency Club president. It's nice to meet you, Sensei.
[Sena]: If you ever have bodies—I mean, wounded—that need transporting, please let me know. We charge a flat rate.
[Sensei]: “S-Sure.”
[Hina]: The Medical Emergency Club is mostly removed from Gehenna's politics, hence why I asked them to do this job.
[Sena]: I'm only interested in the deceased. I'll leave you to dirty your hands with politics.
[Hina]: Again, they're only wounded. I doubt you've ever seen a dead body in person.
[Sena]: My mistake...but the same goes for you, Head Prefect.
[Hina]: Anyway, you have the Gourmet Research Society here? Let's transfer them to this ambulance.
[Hina]: Door opens
[Haruna]: It's so good to see you again, Hina.
[Hina]: *sigh* Haruna... We can talk about this later.
[Akari]: The Medical Emergency Club is here? I thinkI may have dislocated my elbow. Would you mind taking a look at it? ★
[Junko]: Ugh... I think I'm gonna be sick.
[Fuuka]: I'm saved…
[Hina]: You're the School Lunch Club president. I was wondering where you were.
[Hina]: Since you've been gone,juri has been... Well, I'll explain on the way.
[Hina]: Looks like they only managed to capture three of the four Gourmet Research Society members. I'll deal with that problem later.
[Haruna]: Thanks for all the hospitality, Sensei. I'll be sure to treat you to a delectable meal the next time you visit Gehenna.
[Akari]: See you around. ★
[Hina]: Shut up and get in.
[Sensei]: “Take care…”
[Sensei]: Door closes
[Sena]: Transfer complete. Ready to depart.
[Hina]: Hold a moment.
[Hina]: …
[Hina]: Sensei. What are you doing at Trinity?
[Sensei]: "I'm basically the advisor for something called the Make-Up Work Club."
[Hina]: So I've heard. Not much escapes us.
[Hina]: I'm more concerned about the timing. Schale is meant to be a neutral organization. Why would you be spending so many days at Trinity at a time like this? Are you...?
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hina]: Never mind. I can't imagine it.
[Sensei]: "I have something I want to ask you too."
[Hina]: Hmm? What is it?
[Sensei]: Ask Hina for her perspective on the Eden Treaty.
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: <I explained the situation in detail to Hina.>
[Hina]: You're in a very tight spot, Sensei.
[Hina]: But what was that about a swimsuit symposium?
[Sensei]: "Don't worry about it." / "Swimsuit symposium? I didn't say anything like that..."
[Hina]: …
[Hina]: Moving on…
[Hina]: This situation regarding Trinity's traitor is rather complex.
[Hina]: There's no way to know who is telling you the truth and who is filling you with lies.
[Sensei]: "Truth is all a matter of perspective." / "There can be more than one truth."
[Hina]: I'm not sure whether to call you cautious or optimistic.
[Hina]: Are you sure it's okay for you to divulge this information to me?
[Sensei]: "Of course. I trust you more than anyone."
[Hina]: …
[Hina]: There's that bad habit of yours again.
[Sensei]: “...?”
[Hina]: Nothing. I was muttering to myself.
[Hina]: The Eden Treaty being a cover for a military alliance is an interesting perspective…
[Hina]: ...but that's not how I see it. It truly is a peace treaty, as far as I'm concerned.
[Sensei]: "It is?"
[Hina]: Nagisa alone won't be able to control the ETO through the signing of the treaty.
[Hina]: Makoto, the chair of the Pandemonium Society, will have the same authority as her.
[Hina]: And the authority will be further divided among other members of the Tea Party and Pandemonium Society to ensure the ETO isn't abused by one person's will or lose sight of its original purpose.
[Hina]: The latter is still theoretically possible if they all conspired together.
[Hina]: Though if it were that easy for them to cooperate, there wouldn't have been a need for the treaty to begin with. They would have worked on simply integrating the two academies.
[Hina]: I also find it hard to believe that Makoto can get along with anyone.
[Sensei]: "Then why is she in favor of the treaty?"
[Hina]: I don't think she's in favor of it at all... I was the one who pushed for Gehenna to agree to the Eden Treaty.
[Sensei]: “You? But why?”
[Hina]: That's a good question. Perhaps because I saw it as my opportunity to retire.
[Hina]: Gehenna will be much more orderly under the ETO. It wouldn't be necessary for me to continue on as I have.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Sena]: We're still waiting, Head Prefect. Have you said what you needed to?
[Hina]: Yes. I'll be right there.
[Hina]: Best of luck, Sensei.
[Hina]: Hina slowly walks off
[Hina]: You'll keep the Make-Up Work Club safe, won't you?
[Sensei]: “Yes. No matter what.”
[Hina]: Very well.
[Hina]: Until we meet again.
[Hina]: Hina walks away
[Hina]: The car drives off
[Hifumi]: Phew. What a day.
[Hanako]: It sure was. I never expected our innocent little stroll to become such an adventure.
[Azusa]: It was enjoyable, however.
[Koharu]: Heehee.
[Hanako]: You're looking much happier, Koharu. Are you proud that you were able to fight next to Hasumi?
[Koharu]: O-Of course I am! It was my first time.
[Koharu]: It was like a dream come true!
[Hanako]: Aw, that's wonderful. Now you just have to pass your exam like Hasumi told you to.
[Koharu]: I know that! I'm gonna ace the next one for sure. just like an elite would!
[Hanako]: I'm sure you will. I had better study harder so you don't leave me behind.
[Hifumi]: It's getting pretty late. We should get to sleep soon or else studying will be hard tomorrow.
[Hifumi]: Good night, everyone. You too, Sensei.
[Sensei]: "'Night. You all did great today."
[Sensei]: Fade to black
[Sensei]: <This time, the day did finally come to a close.>
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 08 - A Glimmer of Hope
[Sensei]: The Make-Up Work Club finally earn a passing score on their practice test, and Hifumi presents them all with Momo Friends merch. Azusa tells Hifumi that she'll cherish it. Nagisa calls upon Sensei and questions them about their meeting with Mika.
[Azusa]: You're late!
[Hifumi]: Y-You're the one who's early.
[Azusa]: I began studying before sunrise and then quizzed myself on what I had studied.
[Hanako]: Wow. You're really motivated, huh?
[Azusa]: Naturally. Today is yet another mock exam, isn't that right?
[Hifumi]: Yeah, that's true. So that's what you've been preparing for?
[Azusa]: Yes. Our next official exam is only two days away, and I don't want to hold us back.
[Azusa]: I WILL pass today!
[Koharu]: Geez. You almost never get this fired up.
[Azusa]: I repeatedly covered material expected to be on the test. I left no stone unturned.
[Koharu]: W-Well, you're not going to do better than me! I'll show you the elite power of the Justice Task Force!
[Hanako]: That's the spirit. I'll show you what I got this time too.
[Sensei]: "Looks like everyone is ready to go."
[Hifumi]: In that case, let's jump right into the next mock exam!
[Hifumi]: <Second Make-Up Work Club Mock Exam>
[Hifumi]: Fade to white
[Sensei]: “Begin!”
[Sensei]: Clock ticking
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: This isn't so bad.
[Koharu]: I-I know this one! I just have to... Grrr..
[Hifumi]: They're all moving at a much faster pace than before!
[Hifumi]: Bell rings
[Hifumi]: <I graded everyone's tests once the exam was over.>
[Hifumi]: Whenever you're ready, Sensei.
[Sensei]: Check the test results.
[Sensei]: Third Make-Up Work Club Mock Exam Results
[Hanako]: 69 Points (Pass)
[Azusa]: 73 Points (Pass)
[Koharu]: 61 Points (Pass)
[Hifumi]: 75 Points (Pass)
[Hifumi]: W-We did it?! Everyone passed?!
[Koharu]: This isn't a joke, right?!
[Azusa]: Success!
[Hanako]: Well, well!
[Hifumi]: Way to go, Azusa! You didn't just get a D—you jumped all the way up to earning a C!
[Azusa]: Th-Thank you.
[Koharu]: You did good too, Koharu. It was just barely above the line, but you still got a passing score!
[Koharu]: I-I'm not dreaming, am I? That's really my score...?
[Koharu]: See? I told you I've been holding back! This is what I can really do!
[Hifumi]: Way to show us what it means to be a member of the Justice Task Force!
[Hifumi]: You passed this time too, Hanako.
[Hanako]: I must have gotten lucky. What a nice score. ♥
[Hifumi]: I'm happy for you, but…
[Hanako]: What's wrong?
[Hifumi]: I still don't understand why you ended up here, but I'm glad you're taking things seriously.
[Hanako]: Hifumi…
[Hifumi]: I'm going to keep pushing until you recover the scores you had before. I promise.
[Hanako]: I see. I'm sorry I've had you so concerned.
[Hanako]: Time skip
[Hifumi]: Well, now it's time for the promised Momo Friends merchandise giveaway!
[Hifumi]: THUD
[Azusa]: At last!
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: Since everyone passed, you all have a chance to pick! Take whichever one you want!
[Azusa]: Whichever one...I want...!
[Hanako]: I'll pass, but thanks.
[Koharu]: Same.
[Hifumi]: Hmm.
[Azusa]: Which one should I pick? I…
[Azusa]: I can't! Picking only one is impossible!
[Azusa]: The black one with horns looks good, but so is the glasses-wearing hippo!
[Hifumi]: I told you, Peroro is a bird, not a hippo…
[Azusa]: I can't choose just one. What should I do?
[Azusa]: I-I'm sorry, Hifumi. Could I ask you to pick for me?
[Hifumi]: M-Me?
[Hifumi]: Hmm. You said you really like Skullman and Professor Peroro…
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: Picks up
[Hifumi]: Then let's go with the scholarly Professor Peroro!
[Azusa]: Fine! I'll go with this one!
[Hifumi]: Professor Peroro is known for being knowledgeable and studying hard.
[Hifumi]: I picked this one because it suits how much you've learned and how hard you're hitting the books.
[Azusa]: I see. Like an intelligent professor.
[Hifumi]: N-Never mind that the backstory is that Peroro studied so hard that he went a little cuckoo. That part doesn't matter…
[Sensei]: "You seem to like him, Azusa."
[Azusa]: Yes, I really do. Heehee…
[Azusa]: Thank you, Hifumi. I'll cherish it forever.
[Hifumi]: I appreciate it, but you don't have to thank me. You're the one who earned it.
[Azusa]: Maybe so...but this is the first gift I've ever received from a friend.
[Azusa]: I shall think of you every time I gaze upon this hippo!
[Hifumi]: Th-That's a little embarrassing... And I told you: He's a bird, not a hippo!
[Hanako]: Who would have guessed they have so much in common?
[Koharu]: It's creepy…
[Koharu]: Fade to black
[Koharu]: <Morale was high as the group continued to study.>
[Koharu]: Fade to black
[Koharu]: <The day passed calmly and quietly.>
[Hifumi]: Tomorrow's the big day.
[Koharu]: Awww…
[Azusa]: The second exam.
[Hanako]: Is it that time already? The days are flying by.
[Hifumi]: I know it's been a short week, but I'm sure all the hard work we've been putting in will pay off.
[Hifumi]: Passing the last mock exam proved it. We're more than ready!
[Hifumi]: So don't let up! Let's study as hard as we can today!
[Azusa]: Naturally. I won't be satisfied until I score a 100.
[Koharu]: M-Me too!
[Hanako]: I guess I'll just have to do the same.
[Hifumi]: I don't know about getting a perfect score, but I'm sure we can all do this.
[Hifumi]: So let's hit the books! One more day to go!
[Sensei]: "Let's goooooo!"
[Nagisa]: I've been waiting for you. It's been a while, Sensei.
[Nagisa]: How have you been? Is boot camp going smoothly? Anything troubling you?
[Sensei]: "What do you want now?"
[Nagisa]: ...You know, I organized the boot camp to give you an opportunity to observe the students more closely.
[Nagisa]: Was it fruitful? Have you learned anything?
[Nagisa]: More specifically, do you have a leading suspect?
[Sensei]: "I told you I'd handle things my way."
[Nagisa]: I recall. I simply wanted to check in with you now that the second exam is upon us.
[Nagisa]: That's why I asked you here.
[Nagisa]: Black screen
[Nagisa]: As I understand it, you've had contact with Mika recently as well…
[Nagisa]: What did she have to say? Won't you tell me?
[Nagisa]: <<To be Continued>>
[Nagisa]: 09 - A Shadowy Reach
[Nagisa]: Sensei refuses to place doubt on anyone or do anything to root out the traitor. Sensei declines Nagisa's request and declares their intention to block Nagisa's flurry of doubt and ensure that the entire Make-Up Work Club passes.
[Sensei]: "I'm not going to waste my time being paranoid."
[Nagisa]: …?
[Sensei]: "All I want is for the Make-Up Work Club to pass."
[Nagisa]: …
[Nagisa]: Perhaps I should make clear why I chose each of those girls.
[Nagisa]: Though I'm sure you've already been told some version of this...here's the truth.
[Nagisa]: First, Koharu was selected to monitor Hasumi.
[Nagisa]: Hasumi hates Gehenna more than anyone. She's a ticking bomb, and no one knows what she might do.
[Nagisa]: Hanako was an outstanding student that began tanking her grades for unknown reasons. Suspicious.
[Nagisa]: Azusa is shady in her own right. She has a growing rap sheet full of armed conflict with other students.
[Nagisa]: As for Hifumi…
[Sensei]: "I was under the impression you thought highly of her."
[Nagisa]: You're right—I did. Compassion like hers is rare.
[Nagisa]: I've always been very fond of Hifumi, that much is true…
[Nagisa]: ...but we have intelligence that links her with a terrifying criminal organization.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: That's what I fear most: being blinded by trusting someone too dearly. It's a fatal flaw.
[Nagisa]: Even the most meticulously built tower can collapse from a single fault.
[Nagisa]: How well do I truly know Hifumi? Is there another side to her I've never seen? I don't know the answer…
[Sensei]: "But you DO know her! There's just been a terrible misunderstanding!"
[Nagisa]: And you know that how? Are you willing to vouch for her?
[Nagisa]: Can you prove Hifumi's innocence? That she's always been sincere?
[Nagisa]: Your claims mean nothing without concrete proof.
[Nagisa]: It's impossible to prove the sincerity of another's heart.
[Nagisa]: I know full well how compassionate, polite, and kind Hifumi can be...but I'll never be able to prod around and know what's truly in her heart.
[Nagisa]: In the end, we're all strangers.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: That's why they each must be expelled for the sake of the Eden Treaty.
[Sensei]: "I finally get it. It makes perfect sense now."
[Nagisa]: …?
[Sensei]: "You're nothing but a cynical skeptic."
[Nagisa]: Me? Cynical?
[Sensei]: "You only see what you want to see and believe what you want to believe."
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: "Your conspiracies end here." / "The Make-Up Work Club WILL pass."
[Nagisa]: Haha. Very well.
[Nagisa]: This simplifies things.
[Nagisa]: The best of luck to you, Sensei.
[Nagisa]: I'll just have to take matters into my own hands.
[Sensei]: Turn and leave.
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 10 - The Second Exam Part 1
[Sensei]: Sudden changes to the second exam are announced. Everyone is shocked and stunned by the test's newly expanded scope, higher bar to pass, and relocation of the testing site to Gehenna Academy. Azusa insists it's too soon to give up, and the club heads to the test site.
[Hifumi]: I think we did exactly what we set out to do today!
[Hifumi]: Now we're all ready for the second exam tomorrow.
[Hifumi]: We've been at boot camp for a week now, and I know we have what it takes to pass with flying colors.
[Azusa]: Fine…
[Hanako]: That's right!
[Koharu]: Of course!
[Sensei]: "Couldn't agree more."
[Hifumi]: And once we do, we'll all officially graduate from the Make-Up Work Club.
[Hifumi]: Let's not let all of that studying go to waste!
[Hifumi]: We're going to end our time together on a high note!
[Azusa]: I hadn't thought about it, but you're right. We'll have to go our separate ways once we all pass.
[Koharu]: Wh-Why are you getting so sentimental all of a sudden?!
[Hanako]: We've had a lot of fun together. Are you sad to see it end, Azusa?
[Azusa]: No. All things come to an end eventually. For every beginning, there is a conclusion.
[Hanako]: You don't have to make it sound so definite. It isn't as though any of us are truly going anywhere even once the club dissolves.
[Hanako]: We'll still be Trinity students, so we can spend time together whenever we want.
[Koharu]: Y-Yeah! You can visit me at theJustice Task Force club room any time.
[Azusa]: Oh.
[Hifumi]: It's not like we're living the end of a teen drama and never going to see each other again. And we can worry about hanging out again after we've passed our exams.
[Hifumi]: Anyway, why don't we turn in early tonight so that we're rested for tomorrow?
[Koharu]: Where's the exam going to be held anyway? At the academy's main building?
[Hifumi]: Oh, right. I haven't read the announcement yet.
[Hifumi]: Let's see. I just need to check the academy notice board on my phone and…
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Hifumi]: Wh-What?!
[Hanako]: Is something wrong?
[Hanako]: THUD with black
[Hifumi]: Wh-What's going on?!
[Hanako]: Let me see... "Notice of changes made to the second Make-Up Work Club Evaluation Exam".
[Hanako]: "The scope of the exam will be roughly triple that of the first exam."
[Koharu]: What?! Why?!
[Hanako]: "Additionally, the minimum score needed to receive a passing grade has been raised from a 60 to a 90."
[Hifumi]: E-Even I've never scored that high before…
[Koharu]: What the heck is going on?!
[Hifumi]: It looks like this was posted late last night. Why would they make so many sudden changes the day before the exam?
[Sensei]: "Only one person could've done this."
[Sensei]: Cut to Nagisa grinning
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: Most likely. Nagisa must have learned how well we did on our recent mock exam somehow.
[Hanako]: This is her sending a message. She's going to find grounds to expel us, no matter the cost.
[Azusa]: Expel?
[Koharu]: What's this about being expelled?! What are you talking about?!
[Sensei]: (They deserve to know too.)
[Hanako]: Right. We can discuss that later, but there's still more to the notice they posted.
[Hifumi]: It also says the test location and time have been moved. The new location is..."Gehenna district, Zone 15-77. Abandoned building, first floor..."
[Hifumi]: Gehenna district?
[Hifumi]: Why are we taking the exam in Gehenna?!
[Koharu]: That can't be right! Why would a Trinity club be sent there?!
[Hanako]: And I can only assume we'll be failed automatically if we don't comply.
[Koharu]: A-And we're gonna be expelled if that happens?! This is the first anyone's told me!
[Azusa]: …
[Sensei]: Explain the truth.
[Sensei]: Time skip
[Koharu]: We'll be expelled if we fail three exams?
[Azusa]: I won‘t let that happen.
[Hifumi]: I'm sorry we didn't tell you the truth sooner. I never thought things would become this dire…
[Koharu]: B-But I'll never be able to return to theJustice Task Force if I'm expelled!
[Hanako]: I'm so sorry, Koharu.
[Azusa]: Thank you for clarifying. I think we should get moving.
[Hifumi]: Wh-Where? Why now?
[Azusa]: The exam time has been changed. It's taking place at 3 AM. We'll have to leave now if we hope to make it in time.
[Hifumi]: It's at three in the MORNING?! Really?!
[Azusa]: There's no time to be shocked or angry. We can save it for after the exam.
[Azusa]: Complaining about the obstacles they've placed in our way won't accomplish anything. I still intend to fight until I can't fight anymore.
[Hifumi]: Hmm.
[Koharu]: Uh-oh…
[Hanako]: She's right. We can't simply give up.
[Hanako]: Think of it as another fun midnight stroll! I've never ventured all the way to Gehenna just to take an exam.
[Koharu]: Have you two lost your minds? This is getting way too weird!
[Azusa]: Let's depart immediately. Make sure to bring your weapons.
[Hifumi]: Are we going there to fight? I thought we were going to take the exam!
[Hanako]: Gehenna's district is known to be much more dangerous than Trinity's, and the Prefect Team undoubtedly has its hands busy preparing for the treaty.
[Hifumi]: You have to be kidding... Why has it come to this?
[Hifumi]: Guns cocked and loaded
[Azusa]: Please give the order, Sensei.
[Sensei]: "Gear up, everyone. Let's do this!"
[Sensei]: [Gehenna Backstreets]
[Hanako]: We'll officially be in the heart of the Gehenna district just past here. Not exactly the friendliest neighborhood I've ever been in…
[Thug]: Looks like we have some fresh meat! I've never seen YOU around here before!
[Hoodlum]: What's the rush? Why are you in such a hurry?
[Hanako]: This is a little on the nose…
[Hifumi]: W-We're on our way to take an exam.
[Hoodlum]: What are you talkin' about? What exam?
[Hifumi]: I-I know how it sounds…
[Thug]: You can't walk around our turf at night! Who do you think you are?!
[Thug]: Wait. Is that a Trinity uniform?
[Hoodlum]: You mean that rich academy full of princesses? So we could kidnap 'em and hold 'em for ransom, then?
[Thug]: Now you're thinkin'!
[Hifumi]: I was afraid something like this would happen…
[Azusa]: This is a waste of time.
[Azusa]: Ching
[Azusa]: Think fast.
[Azusa]: <Battle Sequence>
[Azusa]: The Make-Up Work Club heads to the test site while laying waste to Gehenna delinquents standing in their way.
[Azusa]: Explosion
[Thug]: Ahhhhhh!
[Thug]: Black Screen and falling
[Hanako]: Well, that was easy.
[Azusa]: Let's keep moving.
[Azusa]: Azusa zooms away
[Koharu]: W-Wait! Don't leave me behind!
[Hifumi]: S-Sorry about all this. We're just passing through.
[Hifumi]: <<To be Continued>>
[Hifumi]: 11 - The Second Exam Part 2
[Hifumi]: The Prefect Team stop the Make-Up Work Club upon their arrival, mistaking them for theJustice Task Force. The Gourmet Research Society arrives just in time and helps clear the way for the Make-Up Work Club. However, everyone still flunks the exam due to Nagisa's interference.
[Hifumi]: [Gehenna District]
[Hifumi]: Footsteps
[Hifumi]: We finally made it.
[Hanako]: Where is everyone? I know it's the middle of the night, but it's like the city is completely deserted.
[Hanako]: Gunfire
[Azusa]: Gunfire. There's a battle nearby.
[Hanako]: As curious as I am, we should stay focused. We need to reach the testing site.
[Hanako]: Footsteps
[Hifumi]: There's a checkpoint up ahead.
[Prefect Team Member A]: Halt! Entry beyond this point is prohibited!
[Prefect Team Member B]: There's a curfew in effect for the entire district. You should be going back to your dorms.
[Prefect Team Member B]: Wait. Don't those uniforms belong to Trinity?
[Prefect Team Member A]: What are Trinity students doing in the Gehenna district?! Are you conspiring to launch an attack?! Answer us!
[Hifumi]: N-No, of course not! We're just passing through…
[Prefect Team Member A]: Trinity girls don't just 'pass through' Gehenna without good reason.
[Hanako]: If you must know, we're here to take an exam. We don't want any trouble.
[Prefect Team Member A]: Since when are Trinity exams held in the Gehenna district?! You expect us to believe that?!
[Hifumi]: I-I know it sounds far fetched, but it's the truth.
[Prefect Team Member B]: Hold on. That girl's wearing a Justice Task Force uniform…
[Prefect Team Member B]: ! Koharu stares embarrassingly
[Prefect Team Member A]: We're under attack! The Justice Task Force is launching an invasion!
[Prefect Team Member B]: Come in, HQ! The enemy has made their move!
[Koharu]: What?! It's not like that!
[Azusa]: It's useless. Let's just wipe them out.
[Hifumi]: But won't that just make us look guilty?!
[Hifumi]: Whoosh
[Hifumi]: Explosion
[Prefect Team Member A]: Ahhhhhh!
[Prefect Team Member B]: They got us…
[Prefect Team Member B]: Both Prefect members fucking die
[Hifumi]: Azusa, WHY?!
[Azusa]: That wasn't me.
[Hanako]: That grenade came from behind us. Who could it be?
[Hanako]: Car screech and door closes
[Akari]: Sorry we're late, Sensei. ★
[Haruna]: Good eye, Akari. So what brings you here?
[Sensei]: "The Gourmet Research Society!"
[Koharu]: A-Aren't these the ones we fought just a couple of nights ago?!
[Hanako]: You're right. They're the ones who attacked the aquarium.
[Hifumi]: I have no idea what's going on anymore…
[Hifumi]: Time skip
[Haruna]: So that's what you're up to. You just need to get to that testing site, right?
[Sensei]: "It's an emergency."
[Haruna]: I can see that, but your timing is most unfortunate. In case you hadn't heard, there's a bit of a situation happening in the district right now.
[Akari]: The Hot Springs Department caused an explosion in the middle of the city. It's a real cluster fudge.
[Haruna]: The Prefect Team has its hands full cleaning up after them, leaving us the perfect opportunity to slip out of our cell.
[Akari]: And wouldn't you know it? The School Lunch Club president just happened to agree to let us borrow the catering truck. Wasn't that nice of her?
[Fuuka]: Hnnngh! Hngh Hngh!
[Akari]: It even still has that new catering truck smell. How kind of her to let us borrow it. What a wonderful friend.
[Fuuka]: Hnnnnnngh!
[Hanako]: It sounds like...someone is tied up in the back of that truck.
[Haruna]: Oh, that? That's just Fuuka's way of having fun. She's a rascal, that one.
[Akari]: No one's better at playing hostage than her! ★
[Junko]: Where the heck are you two?! We managed to get away. Let's meet up already!
[Izumi]: Ahhh! The Prefect Team is still chasing us!
[Haruna]: Sorry,Junko, but there's been a change of plan.
[Junko]: What?! Why?!
[Haruna]: We're going to play escort for Sensei and those Trinity students. There's a debt to repay.
[Akari]: We can talk about the details later. Let's get a move on, people!
[Sensei]: "All right. You drive."
[Hifumi]: U-Uh... Thanks, I think?
[Azusa]: We're taking this catering truck?
[Akari]: Buckle up, everyone. Off we go! ★
[Akari]: Fade to black as the sound of a car drives away
[Akari]: <Two hours later.>
[Akari]: Explosion
[Hifumi]: Ahhhhhh!
[Hifumi]: Another explosion
[Hifumi]: How did it come to this?!
[Koharu]: Stop shaking so much, Hifumi! I can't get a shot!
[Hifumi]: It's not me! That's the ground shaking below us!
[Hifumi]: Another explosion
[Hifumi]: Ahhhhhh! Something exploded again!
[Hifumi]: Intense moped sounds
[Izumi]: That Trinity girl isn't half bad on a bike!
[Junko]: Come on! Try to keep up!
[Hifumi]: I'm trying! I'm trying!
[Haruna]: Expect another explosion in eight seconds, Akari.
[Akari]: Okie doke. No sweat. ★
[Akari]: INTENSE CAR NOISES
[Fuuka]: Harunaaa! Just let me go already!
[Haruna]: Do you hear that? Even Fuuka is cheering us on. Why don't we spice things up a little more?
[Akari]: I like the way you think!
[Koharu]: I-Is that a forklift chasing us?! And a bulldozer?!
[Hifumi]: Why is the Gehenna Hot Springs Department after us?!
[Koharu]: The Prefect Team isn't far behind!
[Azusa]: This is Bravo Squad. Alpha Squad, please respond.
[Hifumi]: A-Azusa?!
[Azusa]: Please use the code names. Anyway, the operation was unsuccessful. We're surrounded.
[Hifumi]: Huh?! What did you just say?
[Azusa]: The Hot Springs Department has the path forward blocked with a flamethrower, and that girl with twin tails from the Prefect Team is blocking the rear.
[Azusa]: Hanako and I will try to escape on our own. We'll see you at the rendezvous point. Good luck.
[Azusa]: <*click*>
[Hifumi]: D-Don't just hang up! Azusa!!!
[Hifumi]: We're only trying to take an exam! That's all!
[Hifumi]: WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!
[Hifumi]: Black screen and a final explosion
[Hifumi]: Hifumi and Koharu, slowly lurching forward
[Hifumi]: Please let it be over…
[Koharu]: I-Is this it? Did we come to the right place?
[Sensei]: "Thank goodness you're both all right."
[Koharu]: Sensei! There you are!
[Hifumi]: I'm glad you're okay too. Sorry we got separated.
[Hifumi]: I feared the worst when the catering truck fell into the river.
[Sensei]: "Haruna gave a thumbs up as we sank into the water. I hope she's okay."
[Koharu]: What about Azusa and Hanako?!
[Koharu]: Black screen
[Hanako]: Don't worry. We're here too.
[Hanako]: Hanako glimmering in her swimsuit
[Azusa]: *inhale* *exhale* It's 2:45 AM. We made it with time to spare.
[Hifumi]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Sensei]: (I want to ask...but let's just move on.)
[Sensei]: Time skip
[Koharu]: So this is the testing site?
[Hanako]: Yeah. First floor of an abandoned building in Gehenna district, Zone 15-77.
[Hifumi]: How are we supposed to take an exam in a place like this? And who's going to administer it?
[Azusa]: I don't sense anyone else here. They must have left something for us.
[Azusa]: Azusa looks around
[Azusa]: !!
[Azusa]: Picks up
[Azusa]: Here. Take a look at this.
[Hanako]: What do we have here? An artillery shell? Inactive, I would hope.
[Azusa]: It's the warhead of an L118 towed artillery—typically used for demonstration and propaganda. The detonator has been removed.
[Hanako]: The L118 belongs to the Tea Party. Which means this was sent by Nagisa.
[Azusa]: Yes. There must be something inside.
[Azusa]: I’ll open it.
[Azusa]: <*click*>
[Hifumi]: There's paper inside... Those must be our exams!
[Azusa]: Still intact as well. There's also a small portable communicator here.
[Nagisa]: So you've managed to arrive in one piece.
[Hifumi]: N-Nagisa?!
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: That voice belongs to the girl you've been talking about?
[Sensei]: "This isn't over, Nagisa!"
[Nagisa]: My, my. I can hear such resentment in your voices... Just kidding. This is a recording, so shouting at me will get you nowhere.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: You have until the deadline to complete your exams, and then you can return.
[Nagisa]: Don't forget: I'll have my eye on you in the meantime. Best of luck, Make-Up Work Club.
[Nagisa]: Do be careful.
[Nagisa]: <*beep*>
[Hifumi]: U-Ugh…
[Hanako]: What was that last comment supposed to mean?
[Azusa]: We don't have much time. Let's begin.
[Hifumi]: You're right! The second evaluation exam officially starts NOW!
[Hanako]: Understood.
[Koharu]: R-Roger!
[Sensei]: "Good luck, everyone... Begin!"
[Sensei]: The gang walk away as it fades to black
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Is this the place?
[Hot Springs Development Member B]: It's the right address. Should be somewhere around here.
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: I don't know who it was, but I'm glad someone tipped us off about there being I don't know who it was, but I'm glad someone tipped us off about there being
[Hot Springs Development Member B]: Back up. Time to blow this place sky high.
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: It's developin' time!
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Click
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: MASSIVE EXPLOSION
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: The Second Evaluation Exam Results
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Hanako - Exam paper lost (Fail)
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Azusa - Exam paper lost (Fail)
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Koharu - Exam paper lost (Fail)
[Hot Springs Development Member A]: Hifumi - Exam paper lost (Fail)
[Koharu]: Our exam papers!
[Azusa]: They're gone. Without a trace…
[Hifumi]: Sensei, are you still with us?
[Sensei]: "I think I'm fine."
[Hanako]: So this was her insurance policy. She really will stop at nothing!
[Hanako]: Fade to black
[Hanako]: The Make-Up Work Club has failed the second exam!
[Hanako]: <<To be Continued>>
[Hanako]: 12 - Back to Square One
[Hanako]: The students are shocked to learn someone in the Tea Party is conspiring to have them expelled. The students decide to return to their respective rooms to decompress. Later that night, Azusa slips out alone with Hanako quietly tailing behind.
[Hanako]: <Later that same day.>
[Koharu]: I can't take this anymore!
[Koharu]: What are we supposed to do?!
[Hifumi]: The whole reason we're here is to avoid being expelled.
[Hifumi]: And if we don't put our heads together and figure something out…
[Hifumi]: ...then we'll all be expelled by this time next week.
[Hanako]: I think this needs something more than a cliché like "put our heads together" to solve. What if we thought outside the box instead?
[Hanako]: Like..."Let's put our bodies together!" How does that sound?
[Hanako]: ?
[Koharu]: Get your mind out of the gutter, you perv, or I'll blow it off your shoulders!
[Hanako]: I'm not sure what you were imagining just now, but I could always demonstrate it for you instead. Why don't you come a little closer?
[Hanako]: Hanako steps closer to Koharu
[Koharu]: H-Hey!
[Koharu]: Hanako steps forward again
[Koharu]: P-Personal space! Stranger danger!
[Hanako]: Here I come!
[Hanako]: KOHARU GETS FUCKING RA-
[Koharu]: No, let me go! Save me, Sensei! Save meeeeee...!
[Koharu]: I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Just let me go already! This isn't how I want my first time to be!
[Azusa]: Fascinating. I've never seen such effective CQC techniques. I'll remember this for later.
[Azusa]: However, I would suggest targeting and snapping her keyjoints first. You made too many unnecessary moves with your hands.
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: Sensei. About Nagisa…
[Sensei]: “I’ll do what I can.”
[Hifumi]: Thank you.
[Hifumi]: We're all going to be expelled at this rate…
[Hifumi]: Fade to black
[Hifumi]: <I went to arrange a meeting with Nagisa after that, but couldn't track down where she was.>
[Hifumi]: <I tried contacting Mika, but even her whereabouts were unknown.>
[Hifumi]: [Annex Building]
[Hanako]: Home sweet home again.
[Azusa]: We thought our time here had come to end, yet here we still are. Life can be very unpredictable.
[Koharu]: Stop being so wishy-washy! We need to come up with a plan!
[Koharu]: A top-ranking Tea Party official is gunning for us in case you forgot. We're screwed at this rate!
[Hifumi]: Our third and final exam is in a week, so we still have one last chance.
[Hanako]: Yes, but we know how far she's willing to stoop to prevent us from even taking it. Our odds aren't looking good.
[Hifumi]: I-I still can't believe she had the testing site destroyed…
[Koharu]: Why is this happening in the first place?! What made her so hellbent to expel US?!
[Koharu]: I'm supposed to believe someone here is gonna betray Trinity?! That doesn't make any sense!
[Koharu]: I'll... I'll never be able to return to the Justice Task Force at this rate…
[Hifumi]: Koharu…
[Azusa]: …
[Sensei]: "It's my fault. I'm the one who provoked Nagisa."
[Hanako]: You were sticking up for us. There's nothing to apologize for.
[Hanako]: I wouldn't have been as nice to that witch if I were in your shoes.
[Azusa]: …
[Hifumi]: Let's not forget we're going to have to raise our scores to nearly perfect within a week.
[Hanako]: That's on top of any other underhanded tricks she might pull to stop us. We'll have to be careful.
[Koharu]: *sob* It's hopeless. I worked so hard just to score a 61. How am I supposed to get my grade even higher?
[Koharu]: I worked as hard as I can already. I'm too dumb for this stuff. I can't... *sob*
[Azusa]: Koharu…
[Hanako]: Don't be so hard on yourself.
[Hifumi]: I think we should get some rest for now.
[Hifumi]: There must be something we can do. I'm sure of it. Sensei and I will try to think of something.
[Hanako]: You need rest just as much as everyone else. You've been pushing yourself harder than any of us.
[Hifumi]: I-I know, but I'm the president…
[Hanako]: I'll help think of a solution too. I can handle it, even while helping Koharu study.
[Hanako]: Like you said, we should all get some rest for now, though.
[Hifumi]: I guess so. Let's head to bed.
[Hanako]: Okay. Good night, everyone.
[Hanako]: Fade to black
[Hanako]: Six days until final exam.
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Azusa walks away
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: <<To be Continued>>
[Hanako]: 13 - In Spite of Everything
[Hanako]: The Make-Up Work Club prepares for the final exam despite being backed up against the wall. Hanako quietly watches as Azusa has a secret meeting with Saori the day before the exam.
[Hanako]: <The Make-Up Work Club continued to study hard every day in preparation for the third exam.>
[Hanako]: This is a masterpiece, that I can’t give enough justice to.

[Hifumi]: Two days until the final exam.
[Hifumi]: One day until the final exam.
[Hifumi]: Tomorrow's the big day.
[Hanako]: That it is.
[Azusa]: …
[Koharu]: They aren't going to change the time and place again at the last second, are they?
[Hifumi]: I've checked, and nothing's changed as of yet.
[Hanako]: It's still the same time and place, but we have to score a 90 or higher too.
[Hanako]: Trinity Building 19, Classroom 32. It's on the outskirts of the district, but not unreasonably far away.
[Hanako]: The exam begins at 9 AM—exactly as scheduled.
[Hanako]: The only strange thing I've noticed this week is how quiet the main campus has been. I haven't seen any students around at all.
[Hanako]: I'm going to keep an eye on the notice board just in case.
[Hifumi]: But you need to get a good night's sleep just like the rest of us.
[Hanako]: I'll be fine. It's the least I can do for everyone.
[Hifumi]: That's not true at all! You've helped us immensely this week. The rest of us were only able to raise our scores as high as we did because of your tutoring.
[Hanako]: You're giving me too much credit. It was you three who put in all the hard work.
[Hanako]: You were burning the candle at both ends every single night to study.
[Sensei]: "I think you should all be proud."
[Hifumi]: Scoring a 90 or higher on any test can be hard, but maybe—just maybe—if all the questions seem familiar, then…
[Azusa]: …
[Koharu]: That's just wishful thinking! I'm gonna cram all night this time!
[Koharu]: They can't fail me ifI score 100 points! Just watch!
[Hifumi]: That's true Koharu, but I really think you should rest tonight.
[Hanako]: We all know how hard you've been working. Don't let it go to waste by being too tired to focus tomorrow.
[Azusa]: True. Your body needs to be just as prepared as your mind.
[Hanako]: That goes for you too, Azusa.
[Azusa]: I know. I'll be well-rested—for tonight at least.
[Hifumi]: It all comes down to tomorrow.
[Azusa]: I... No, let's leave it at that. I promise to pass tomorrow.
[Koharu]: Me too! I'm not going down like this!
[Hifumi]: It's strange. I was feeling kinda down about our chances. But you two are right—I should be more optimistic.
[Hanako]: You should. Everyone's done the best they can do.
[Sensei]: "The situation is dire, sure, but have faith in yourselves."
[Hifumi]: Yes, Sensei.
[Hanako]: Right.
[Azusa]: Yes.
[Koharu]: …
[Koharu]: Fade to black
[Koharu]: Less than 12 hours from the final exam.
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Azusa walks away
[Hanako]: …
[???]: The fated day has changed, Azusa.
[Azusa]: It has?
[???]: Tomorrow morning. Wait for further orders at the agreed point.
[Azusa]: H-Hold on, Saori. Tomorrow, I'm supposed to be…
[Saori]: Is there a problem?
[Azusa]: Preparations are incomplete. Changing to an earlier date poses an immense risk.
[Saori]: The decision is final. Trust your training and be ready, Azusa.
[Azusa]: …
[Saori]: The course of history will change tomorrow—for both Arius and Trinity.
[Saori]: Don't lose sight of your mission. You are to destroy the halo of the Tea Party's leader, Kirifuji Nagisa. Nothing else matters.
[Azusa]: …
[Saori]: I know you can handle yourself. Just as you did with Seia.
[Azusa]: Understood. I won't object any further.
[Azusa]: I should prepare for tomorrow's mission.
[Azusa]: Azusa walks away
[Saori]: Azusa.
[Azusa]: ...?
[Saori]: Never forget. Vanitas vanitatum.
[Azusa]: Everything is in vain. Of course.
[Azusa]: All efforts, achievements, and even failures are meaningless in the end.
[Azusa]: I've never lost sight of that—not even once.
[Azusa]: Azusa walks away
[Saori]: …
[Saori]: Scene change
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: <<To be Continued>>
[Hanako]: 14 - A Confession
[Hanako]: The students gather together at night. Azusa confesses that she is the traitor once the full scope of Nagisa's interference is revealed. Azusa blames herself, but Sensei says it isn't her fault. Hanako declares they will find a way to pass no matter what.
[Hanako]: [Sensei’s Room]
[Hanako]: Knocking
[Hanako]: Door opens
[Hifumi]: Hi, Sensei... I thought you might still be awake.
[Sensei]: "Having trouble sleeping too?"
[Hifumi]: Yes. I just can't manage to fall asleep.
[Hifumi]: Knocking
[Hifumi]: Door opens
[Hanako]: Don't forget about me!
[Hifumi]: Hanako…
[Hifumi]: Door opens
[Koharu]: What are you all doing in here?
[Hifumi]: Shouldn't you be asleep, Koharu?
[Koharu]: Look who's talking! Tomorrow's exam day for all of us!
[Hanako]: She‘s got us there…
[Koharu]: Azusa ran off somewhere from the looks of it too.
[Koharu]: I can get why she'd be anxious, but…
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: Actually, I went out too. I met with some of my contacts from the Sisterhood. There were a few things I was trying figure out.
[Hanako]: It's about the building where we're scheduled to have our exam.
[Hifumi]: D-Don't tell me they changed the location again!
[Hanako]: No, it's not that. I was told the entire Justice Task Force has been dispatched to defend the building.
[Koharu]: …?!
[Hifumi]: All of them...?
[Hanako]: The Tea Party told them the building houses sensitive documents relating to the Eden Treaty and to protect it at any cost.
[Hanako]: The entire campus is under martial law. That explains why things have been so quiet.
[Hifumi]: Y-You can't be serious. Nothing like this has ever happened before.
[Hanako]: No one is being allowed to enter or leave campus until the Eden Treaty has been signed.
[Koharu]: Then how are we supposed to take our exam tomorrow?!
[Hanako]: We'll essentially have to fight the entireJustice Task Force if we want to take the exam.
[Hifumi]: No…
[Koharu]: That can't be right... I should try contacting Hasumi.
[Hanako]: I don't think that will do any good. Hasumi and the others were likely kept in the dark about their orders' real purpose.
[Hanako]: She would be disobeying orders if she helped us. Hasumi would be expelled from theJustice Task Force at the very least.
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: Nagisa is not going to relent. She will do everything in her power to have the Make-Up Work Club expelled.
[Hifumi]: Is all of this really necessary? Why is she so paranoid?
[Hifumi]: Door opens
[Azusa]: It's because of me.
[Hifumi]: Azusa?! Where have you been?!
[Hanako]: …
[Azusa]: There's something I have to tell all of you.
[Hifumi]: Azusa?
[Azusa]: …
[Koharu]: Are you sick or something? You look so pale.
[Hifumi]: And you're shaking.
[Azusa]: There's something I've been hiding from you…
[Azusa]: ...but I can't hide it any longer.
[Azusa]: Fade to black
[Azusa]: I'm the one Nagisa is looking for. I am Trinity's traitor.
[Azusa]: …
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Koharu]: What are you talking about?
[Hanako]: …
[Azusa]: I originally attended the Arius Satellite School. I was able to infiltrate Trinity because my documents were forged.
[Hifumi]: A-Arius? Infiltrated...?
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Koharu]: Wait. What's Arius?
[Hanako]: The Arius Satellite School...was the faction that opposed the Trinity alliance when it was formed many years ago.
[Hanako]: A lot of complications arose from that, and Arius has been in hiding ever since, as I understand it.
[Azusa]: That's correct. I had never once left the Arius district in my life until I began this mission.
[Azusa]: I infiltrated Trinity at Arius' behest.
[Azusa]: My mission is...to destroy Nagisa's halo.
[Hifumi]: What?! That means you're...!
[Koharu]: Your...mission is to kill her?
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Correct. Arius is determined to eliminate the Tea Party at all costs.
[Azusa]: Arius convinced Mika to place me at Trinity under the guise of reconciling relations between our two academies.
[Hanako]: They must have targeted her because of her inexperience and naivety. Mika isn't nearly as politically adept as Nagisa.
[Hanako]: They may have even planned to pin the blame on her after the deed was done.
[Hanako]: I've heard Arius and Trinity were mortal enemies, but I never could have imagined that something like this was being plotted in this day and age.
[Koharu]: Why tell us any of this? What's it got to do with us?
[Koharu]: I get a lot is going on behind the scenes between Trinity and Arius, but what's it have to do with our club?
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Azusa]: Arius students will advance on Trinity tomorrow morning with their sights set on Nagisa…
[Azusa]: ...and I'm going to protect her.
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: Y-You're going to protect Nagisa?! But tomorrow is...!
[Koharu]: …?!
[Azusa]: I know, but there's no other choice. I must stop them.
[Hanako]: The campus is under martial law, but Nagisa has the entireJustice Task Force stationed at the building where we're supposed to have our exam. The main building will be practically defenseless.
[Hanako]: There's never been a better time for an attack. That's why Arius is striking now.
[Hifumi]: Hanako…
[Koharu]: Wait, something still doesn't make sense!
[Koharu]: You said your mission was to assassinate Nagisa! Why do you suddenly want to protect her?!
[Azusa]: That's because…
[Azusa]: Black screen
[Hanako]: Because that's the real reason you enrolled at Trinity, isn't it?
[Hanako]: !
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: You took on the mission to assassinate Nagisa because your real objective was to protect her from the very beginning. You're a double agent, aren't you?
[Hanako]: You've been telling Arius what they want to hear, but in secret you've been preparing to betray them.
[Hanako]: Cut to Azusa and Saori meeting
[Hanako]: Present
[Hanako]: So why protect Nagisa? Whose orders are you following?
[Azusa]: No one's. This is my own decision.
[Azusa]: The Eden Treaty will fall through without Nagisa. If that happens, Kivotos will only plunge further into chaos.
[Azusa]: And more academies could suffer the same fate Arius has.
[Hanako]: Are you saying you're doing this for the sake of peace?
[Hanako]: You're being naive. What you're attempting is as foolish as the treaty itself, Azusa.
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: You're a liar and a traitor.
[Hanako]: You hid your identity from Trinity and your true intentions from Arius. You've lied to everyone around you and deceived them into thinking you're someone you're not. Isn't that right?
[Hifumi]: Hanako…
[Azusa]: I told you before. I knew a day would come where I betray everything I've ever known—my friends, my faith, and my heart.
[Hifumi]: Oh, Azusa. Why...?
[Azusa]: As I said, I'm the traitor Nagisa has been searching for. I've put the Make-Up Work Club in grave danger.
[Azusa]: I'm sorry... I understand if you despise me—welcome it, even. Everything that's happening is my fault.
[Sensei]: "That's not true, Azusa."
[Azusa]: Sensei?
[Sensei]: "We're in this crisis because Nagisa didn't trust anyone."
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Cut to Nagisa
[Sensei]: "If only Nagisa had trusted the four of you."
[Sensei]: Cut to Mika
[Sensei]: "And if Mika had believed in Nagisa, then..."
[Sensei]: Present
[Sensei]: "...none of this would've happened. This is where being untrusting led us."
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: Yes, I know, Sensei. I'm actually very aware of that.
[Hanako]: I also know it's nearly impossible to change someone as jaded as Nagisa. She has no faith in anyone but herself.
[Hanako]: Yet the same can't be said about our little Azusa. She trusted us with the truth and apologized. She didn't even make excuses or become defensive when I pushed her buttons.
[Hanako]: Sorry I did that, but I couldn't help tease you when I saw your adorable and innocent expression. It was tugging on my heartstrings a little too tightly.
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: It's strange. Our Make-Up Work Club has become the center stage of everything happening, and there's a great big spotlight exposing all of our dirty little secrets.
[Hanako]: Normally, you wouldn't expect a spy like Azusa to remain in the spotlight for very long.
[Hanako]: You could have disappeared without a trace weeks ago if you truly wanted to…
[Hanako]: Black screen
[Hanako]: ...and yet you didn't.
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: And I thinkI know why…
[Hanako]: It was because you were having so much fun.
[Azusa]: …!
[Hanako]: You enjoyed us studying together, eating together—even doing the laundry and cleaning together. You had fun every single time.
[Hanako]: You didn't want the fun times together to end.
[Hanako]: You reveled in us all working together toward the same goal. You've had fun learning beside your clubmates and Sensei.
[Hanako]: Isn't that right, Azusa?
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Well, I…
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Yes. You're right.
[Azusa]: I can't think of any other explanation.
[Azusa]: I enjoyed learning new things with each of you and sharing our lives…
[Azusa]: ...and I didn't want that to change.
[Azusa]: There's still so much more to learn and places we can go together.
[Azusa]: Like the beach, festivals, and theme parks.
[Hifumi]: Azusa…
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: I understand. I knew someone who felt the same way.
[Azusa]: …?
[Hanako]: She was so talented and adept. Everyone couldn't help but adore and praise the things she did.
[Hanako]: Flashback
[Students]: Splendid job, Urawa! That was a complex problem.
[Students]: Next scene
[Student Officer]: Heh heh. We could really use your support, Urawa.
[Student Officer]: Next scene
[The Sisterhood]: Why not join us, Urawa. We're the only ones who can keep the Tea Party in check.
[The Sisterhood]: Next scene
[Tea Party Admin]: Be ready, Hanako. There will almost certainly be a seat open for you at the Tea Party next year.
[Tea Party Admin]: Next scene
[???]: *sigh*
[???]: This isn't me…
[???]: All I want to do is…
[???]: Fade to black
[Hanako]: She found Trinity General School to be a place replete with deception, prejudice, and hypocrisy.
[Hanako]: It was somewhere she couldn't open herself up to anyone or be her true self.
[Hanako]: Next scene
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: Aren't you lonely?
[Seia]: Present
[Hifumi]: …
[Hanako]: Everything felt so meaningless to her, so she tried her hardest to drop out of the academy.
[Hanako]: For her, it was like breaking out of prison.
[Hanako]: You're a much different girl than she was, Azusa. Perhaps better, even.
[Hanako]: Come to think of it, you completing this mission would mean the end of your academy life, wouldn't it?
[Hanako]: You enrolled under false pretenses and plan to betray the place you originally came from. You'll have nowhere to return to once this is over.
[Hifumi]: Th-That hadn't even dawned on me…
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: You knew that was inevitable, yet you still worked your heart out while in the Make-Up Work Club.
[Hanako]: That other girl tanked her exams on purpose so she could run away while you dedicated yourself to the fullest.
[Hanako]: Why? Why try so hard? You said it your self: vanitas vanitatum. Vanity of vanities—everything is in vain.
[Hanako]: There is undoubtedly some truth in those words…
[Hanako]: ...and yet, that's not all you said. There was something else you added at the end.
[Hanako]: Flashback
[Azusa]: Yes. Even if everything is in vain, there's no reason we shouldn't give life our all.
[Azusa]: Next scene
[Azusa]: But you shouldn't allow yourself to be bullied. Even if everything is meaningless, you should never give up.
[Azusa]: Present
[Hanako]: It was then that the girl I spoke of realized something.
[Hanako]: She realized how much fun academy life can truly be.
[Hanako]: Cleaning the swimming pool in her underwear, going out for a midnight stroll in nothing but her swimsuit, having a symposium with her friends as they wore absolutely nothing at all... It was so much fun.
[Azusa]: That's...not how I recall most of those.
[Hifumi]: It was a SWIMSUIT symposium! We were wearing our swimsuits!
[Koharu]: So you DID clean the pool in your panties! You admit it!
[Hanako]: Heehee. ♥
[Hanako]: It turns out that girl isn't so different from you after all, Azusa. So, even if everything is in vain, I don't think we should give up just yet.
[Azusa]: Hanako…
[Hanako]: Didn't you say you wanted to learn more? Discover more?
[Hanako]: That there was so much more you wanted to experience? Like visiting the beach or staying out all night.
[Hanako]: Why give up on those dreams now?
[Hanako]: There's no reason to. Nothing has changed.
[Hanako]: Your mission is now OUR mission. We'll protect Kirifuji Nagisa from Arius' attack.
[Hanako]: And then we're going to take our exam and pass.
[Hanako]: That witch won't have any complaints once we do that. We'll pass—even with all of the ridiculous conditions she's placed on us.
[Hanako]: It doesn't matter how many soldiers she places in front of that testing site or how many subjects the exam covers. We're each going to score a 90 or higher.
[Hanako]: Because what other choice do we have?
[Azusa]: But...how? It should be physically impossible.
[Azusa]: Arius' attack coincides with the start of the exam.
[Hifumi]: Could we maybe ask others for help...?
[Hanako]: No.
[Hanako]: It won't be enough to help us pass our exam.
[Hanako]: If we're going to do this, we'll need to get one step ahead.
[Hanako]: Up until now, we've been playing right into our opponents' hands. This time, we're going to devise something of our own. We already have all the talent we need in this very room.
[Hanako]: A member of theJustice Task Force, a guerrilla warfare expert, a seemingly average student favored by the Tea Party, and me, someone who knows everything there is to know about Trinity.
[Koharu]: …?
[Hifumi]: F-Favored...?
[Azusa]: …?
[Hanako]: And to top it off, we have [NAME] Sensei: the ever-capable leader of Schale.
[Sensei]: "I...suppose, yeah."
[Hanako]: With a lineup like this…
[Hanako]: ...we could overthrow Trinity in half a day!
[Hifumi]: Wh-What?!
[Koharu]: Who said anything about doing that?!
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: Relax. I know the plan is to take the third exam and avoid failing. ♥
[Hanako]: I'll devise the plan. All you have to do is follow instructions and give your all.
[Hanako]: Now let's show them what we're made of!
[Sensei]: "L-Let's goooooo?"
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 15 - Lighting the Fuse
[Sensei]: Arius forces come to ambush Nagisa, but Azusa and Hanako beat them to the punch and kidnap Nagisa themselves. Afterwards, Azusa engages in combat with the subsequent rush of Arius students.
[Sensei]: Arius troops march in
[Arius Student A]: Squad IV confirming arrival.
[Arius Student B]: Conditions as expected. No additional security spotted.
[Arius Student B]: Radio noises
[Arius Student C]: Units V, VI, and VII are all on standby.
[Arius Student A]: Target's location confirmed. Operation will proceed as scheduled.
[Arius Student A]: Move out.
[Arius Student A]: Arius troops move out
[Nagisa]: *sigh*
[Nagisa]: Knocking
[Nagisa]: No. I've had my fill of tea.
[Nagisa]: Door creaks open
[Nagisa]: Huh?
[Nagisa]: Black screen
[???]: Having trouble sleeping?
[Nagisa]: …?!
[Nagisa]: Hanako appears
[Hanako]: You must be anxious. Understandable, since you had the entireJustice Task Force deployed away from here.
[Nagisa]: U-Urawa Hanako?! What are you doing here?
[Hanako]: Are you asking howI knew you'd be at this particular safe house? That's because I know the rotation order of all 87 panic rooms used by the Tea Party.
[Nagisa]: …?!
[Hanako]: I also know about the measures that fall just outside of the regulations too—like how you like to hide in this secret penthouse of yours when you're especially nervous.
[Nagisa]: Wh-What is the meaning of this?!
[Nagisa]: Gun cocks
[Azusa]: Don't move.
[Nagisa]: …!
[Hanako]: By the way, we already met your minimal security detail on our way here. They're going to be indisposed for a little while.
[Nagisa]: Both Urawa Hanako and Shirasu Azusa. It couldn't be…
[Nagisa]: To think there wasn't just one traitor, but two.
[Hanako]: No, not quite. Besides, Azusa and I are just the meeting party. Someone else here is calling the shots.
[Nagisa]: …!
[Nagisa]: Who?! I demand to know who it is!
[Hanako]: Answer my question first. Did you truly need to go this far, Nagisa?
[Nagisa]: …
[Hanako]: I'm referring to how you've handled our club. I understand why you would be so concerned, but did you really need to involve Schale and its authority as well?
[Nagisa]: Well....
[Hanako]: I can even see why you would find Azusa and myself to be so suspicious, but why cast doubt on someone like Hifumi too? Why involve an innocent bystander like Koharu?
[Nagisa]: …
[Hanako]: Especially Hifumi. She thought you were her friend.
[Hanako]: How could you be so cruel? Did you ever consider how much it would hurt her?!
[Nagisa]: …
[Nagisa]: I recognize what I put Hifumi through wasn't right, even ifI had the greater good in mind.
[Nagisa]: Part of me hoped we could still be friends when all of this was over...but I have no regrets.
[Hanako]: Heehee. ♥
[Hanako]: Then I should deliver a message to you from our commander.
[Hanako]: She says, "It was a funny fantasy, thinking we were ever really friends."
[Nagisa]: What? Then the one leading you is...?
[Nagisa]: Black screen and gunfire
[Azusa]: Target secured.
[Azusa]: She took an entire 5.56mm round magazine point blank. She'll be out for at least another hour.
[Hanako]: Excellent work, Azusa. Would you mind playing decoy from here on like we planned?
[Azusa]: Understood. This should allow the false intel to reach Trinity's true traitor.
[Azusa]: Arius will have no choice but to hasten their attack if your theory is correct.
[Hanako]: That's right. There are some questions still to be answered…
[Hanako]: ...but I'm convinced that there really is a traitor, at the very least.
[Azusa]: By the way. Was the last thing you said to her really necessary?
[Hanako]: Oh, that was just my little way of repaying Hifumi. Nagisa had that one coming.
[Hanako]: Besides, I'm sure that little misunderstanding will be cleared up sooner or later. ♥
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: Never mind that. Can you tell me how many soldiers Arius will be sending? Will you be able to hold them off by yourself?
[Azusa]: I don't know the exact number, but I've been preparing for this.
[Azusa]: I set traps and dug trenches around the academy every night. I'll lure them there and use the terrain to my advantage to buy time.
[Azusa]: I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
[Hanako]: All right. See you soon!
[Hanako]: Azusa and Hanako split up
[Hanako]: Door slams
[Arius Student A]: Panic room clear! Target not found!
[Arius Commander]: Someone else has been here. The intel was credible.
[Arius Commander]: Search the perimeter! Make sure not to be seen!
[Arius Commander]: Where is the spy we were supposed to make contact with?! We need an update!
[Arius Student C]: This is Unit IV! I-It's an ambush!
[Arius Commander]: What?!
[Arius Commander]: Azusa standing in smoke
[Arius Student C]: Our contact! We've been had!
[Azusa]: (huff puff)
[Arius Student C]: Ahhhhhh!
[Arius Commander]: Wh-What's happening?! The spy betrayed us?!
[Arius Commander]: Gunfire and explosions
[???]: Yes. I have.
[Arius Commander]: ...?!
[Azusa]: Your target has been intercepted.
[Arius Commander]: Wh-Why?! Why would you do something like this?!
[Azusa]: Because I have an exam to take in a few hours.
[Arius Commander]: Huh?!
[Azusa]: Also, theJustice Task Force has been informed of the situation. If you're going to retreat, I would suggest you do it now.
[Azusa]: <*click*>
[Arius Commander]: …
[Arius Student A]: What are we going to do? Should we retreat?
[Arius Commander]: No, she's bluffing. According to the intel we received, theJustice Task Force won't be going anywhere.
[Arius Commander]: It's psychological warfare. She wants us to retreat. Chase after her!
[Arius Students]: Yes!
[Arius Students]: <<To be Continued>>
[Arius Students]: 16 - A Fearsome Clash
[Arius Students]: Arius students launch an attack and succeed in backing the Make-Up Work Club into a corner. The Make-Up Work Club and Sensei begin their counterattack.
[Arius Students]: [Boot Camp Site]
[Arius Student A]: This way! We confirmed that she took the target and entered this building!
[Arius Commander]: This must be where Shirasu Azusa has built her stronghold.
[Arius Student B]: Only two entrances lead inside! One is barricaded.
[Arius Commander]: She's left only one entrance—a likely trap. Destroy the barricade and enter through the other!
[Arius Student A]: That will give away our position. Are you sure this is what you want to do?
[Arius Commander]: Yes. I was just informed by Squad that reinforcements are on their way.
[Arius Commander]: We can no longer consider this an assassination mission. We're at war with Trinity. We must retrieve the target!
[Arius Commander]: Prepare yourselves!
[Arius Commander]: Black screen and explosions
[Arius Commander]: Arius troops march in
[Arius Commander]: Charge!
[Azusa]: Just as expected.
[Arius Student A]: A trap?!
[Arius Student A]: Kaboom
[Arius Student A]: Black screen
[Arius Student B]: Ahhhhhh!
[Arius Commander]: Don't falter! If we can just make it inside, we'll easily outnumber her!
[Arius Commander]: Explosion
[Arius Student]: Ahhhhhh! Another trap!
[Arius Student]: Next scene
[Arius Student]: Explosion
[Arius Student]: Claymore mines!
[Arius Student]: Next scene
[Arius Student]: Explosion
[Arius Student]: That bag was an IED! Ahhhhhh!
[Arius Student]: Next scene
[Arius Student]: Arius troops march in
[Arius Commander]: Your insubordination ends here, Shirasu Azusa.
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: Wow, you took out so many of them, Azusa.
[Azusa]: True.
[Arius Commander]: You're trapped. Now tell me where the target is.
[Azusa]: Hidden within the building.
[Arius Commander]: We have reinforcements on the way. You'll be surrounded. There's no escape.
[Azusa]: Just how many reinforcements?
[Arius Commander]: More than you can handle!
[Azusa]: And what about Squad?
[Arius Commander]: Unrequired. On another mission.
[Azusa]: That simplifies things.
[Azusa]: Azusa runs away
[Arius Commander]: Where do you think you're going?! There's nothing but a gym there. I told you: Escape is impossible!
[Arius Commander]: Her traps have been disarmed! Chase after her!
[Arius Commander]: The Make-Up Work Club members group up
[Arius Commander]: NowI see. Setting up an ambush, were you?
[Arius Commander]: And this is your choice of battlefield?
[Arius Commander]: How long can you hold out with just four of you? This will be your tomb!
[Hifumi]: U-Ugh…
[Koharu]: …
[Azusa]: You're correct. There's nowhere to escape—for you.
[Hanako]: It's time for the finishing touches. ♥
[Sensei]: "I've been waiting for this."
[Arius Commander]: …!
[Hanako]: Welcome to a tactical command class led by none other than Schale's advisor and the Make-Up Work Club's homeroom teacher: Sensei! ♥
[Azusa]: Commencing with the elimination of targets.
[Sensei]: "Let's go, Make-Up Work Club!"
[Sensei]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Sensei]: <<To be Continued>>
[Sensei]: 17 - The Way of the World Part 1
[Sensei]: The Make-Up Work Club and Sensei defeat the Arius forces but are met with reinforcements. Mika arrives and reveals herself to be the true traitor of Trinity before ordering the Arius students to subdue the Make-Up Work Club.
[Sensei]: Gunfire
[Arius Commander]: Gahhhhhh!
[Arius Commander]: Arius commander fucking dies
[Koharu]: Is it over?
[Azusa]: All enemy units incapacitated.
[Hifumi]: Sensei's commands really are something else. Wow…
[Hanako]: Well, that's one crisis averted at least.
[Hanako]: Arius' reinforcements will arrive soon. Our objective is to buy time until then.
[Hanako]: We need to hold out until the Justice Task Force intervenes, or everything we've done will go to waste.
[Koharu]: I-I've already contacted Hasumi! She should respond soon!
[Hanako]: Good job. TheJustice Task Force is still under the Tea Party's direct command, so this was the only way to get them to move from their post.
[Hanako]: Hasumi should have noticed that Nagisa has gone missing by now.
[Hanako]: You contacting Hasumi should speed things along. It's only a matter of time before the Justice Task Force confirms the situation.
[Hanako]: I just hope they arrive in time…
[Hanako]: Explosion
[Hanako]: …?!
[Azusa]: Reinforcements…
[Azusa]: Arius students arrive in droves
[Hanako]: They're here already?
[Koharu]: H-How?!
[Koharu]: More Arius students arrive
[Azusa]: This is more like an army than a reinforcement unit. Half of the satellite school's roster must be here…
[Hifumi]: Th-They've sent this many forces into Trinity territory?!
[Hanako]: And still no sign of the Justice Task Force.
[Hanako]: Black screen
[???]: Of course there isn't.
[???]: A dark figure appears
[Hanako]: Y-You!
[Hanako]: Mika reveals herself
[Mika]: You've been surrounded by the armed force that will replace them as Trinity's official army.
[Sensei]: “Mika…?”
[Mika]: It's good to see you again, Sensei.
[Mika]: As I was saying, theJustice Task Force won't be moving from their post. My orders.
[Mika]: You noticed, didn't you? Just how empty campus was this morning?
[Mika]: I've removed every obstacle in my way and given stand down orders to anyone and everyone under the Tea Party's command.
[Mika]: I wouldn't want anyone to interfere with our assault on Nagi.
[Hanako]: Misono Mika of the Tea Party…
[Mika]: That's me. And here I am, making my grand appearance as the mastermind behind everything. ☆
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: You can consider me to be Trinity's true traitor.
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: …
[Koharu]: …?!
[Mika]: Won't you tell me where you've hid Nagi? I don't have much time.
[Mika]: Or we can always eliminate all of you and search this place top to bottom the hard way.
[Sensei]: "Why, Mika? Why...?"
[Mika]: Hmm? You want to know why I'm doing this, Sensei?
[Mika]: Because I hate Gehenna.
[Mika]: I sincerely loathe Gehenna Academy from the depths of my heart.
[Hanako]: Then was your real objective to stop the Eden Treaty from being signed? That's why you're targeting Nagisa?
[Mika]: Uh...who are you again? Sorry, I've always been awful at remembering faces.
[Mika]: Wait, I remember now. You're Urawa Hanako, right? The one who was kicked out of chapel for attending in a swimsuit. Hahaha!
[Hanako]: …
[Mika]: Well, to answer your question: That's correct. I mean, Nagi's Eden Treaty idea was completely ridiculous. Ludicrous.
[Mika]: A peace treaty with those wretches? Just the thought of coexisting with them makes my skin crawl.
[Mika]: And how long would that last? How many years—weeks—no, DAYS until we end up with a knife in our back?
[Mika]: I simply can't allow something like that to happen.
[Mika]: For being such a paranoid girl, Nagi really is too naive. This isn't a fairy tale. There's no happily ever after waiting beyond her treaty.
[Mika]: It's about time she came to grips with the reality around us.
[Mika]: So hand her over. I promise not to kill her. She may have to spend the rest of her school life in confinement, but it won't be so bad.
[Sensei]: "So the Eden Treaty was a peace treaty after all."
[Mika]: Oh, that. Yes, I'm sorry for deceiving you, Sensei. The little conversation we had wasn't entirely truthful.
[Mika]: Someone as ignorant and naive as Nagi would never think to use the Eden Treaty to create a military alliance under her control.
[Mika]: But not everything was a lie, Sensei.
[Mika]: I was telling the truth about reconciling with Arius.
[Mika]: Arius troops appear behind
[Mika]: See? They make rather loyal comrades for someone wanting to wage war against Gehenna.
[Mika]: As I told you, Arius was once one of us: an academy that would have otherwise joined the Trinity union. Of course they hate Gehenna—they always have. Theirs is an academy held together by animosity.
[Mika]: That's why I extended an olive branch to them. I offered them the opportunity to stop a villain aiming to welcome Gehenna with open arms.
[Mika]: I said that if the current host, Kirifuji Nagisa, has theJustice Task Force by her side now, then the next host, Misono Mika, will have Arius beside hers.
[Mika]: What an offer, don'tcha think? Talk about making peace.
[Mika]: The enemy of my enemy is my friend, as the saying goes. That's why I have been secretly supporting Arius.
[Azusa]: You've been using Arius to stage a coup d'état from the very beginning…
[Mika]: I suppose you could refer to it as that. Nagi will be overthrown and I will become the host of the Tea Party, yes.
[Mika]: You have my gratitude, Azusa. We may as well be strangers, yet you're oh-so special to me. I owe you such a great debt…
[Mika]: ...for taking the fall as the assailant who attacked Nagi.
[Koharu]: …!
[Mika]: You'll be the scapegoat. We need someone to take responsibility, because otherwise, how will the public rest until the perpetrator is brought to justice?
[Mika]: I know it's a little unimaginative, but that can't really be helped. This is just the way the world works sometimes.
[Azusa]: …
[Mika]: You really did surprise me, though. I thought all of my planning was going to be thwarted when Ifirst heard Nagi had been attacked. You forced my hand, and I had to come handle this personally.
[Mika]: I wasn't expecting such a bold move from the Make-Up Work Club. Well done.
[Sensei]: "You did all this to become the host of the Tea Party?"
[Mika]: That's right.
[Mika]: Oh, but don't be mistaken, Sensei. This isn't about seizing power for the sake of being powerful.
[Mika]: I simply want to erase Gehenna from Kivotos. That's all.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: I'm going to purge Trinity of all the moderates and idealists that agreed with Nagi and fill their seats with leaders from Arius.
[Mika]: This may very well be the start of a new alliance. We could even hold a new council to commemorate it. That wouldn't be such a bad idea, would it?
[Mika]: And then! The newly remade Trinity will declare all-out war on Gehenna! That's the plan!
[Mika]: Black screen
[Sensei]: "That's enough!"
[Mika]: H-Hey, don't scare me like that.
[Mika]: I've never heard you raise your voice like that. I guess you weren't a fan of my explanation, huh?
[Mika]: Arius troops march forward
[Mika]: That's fine. We can talk it over more once I've taken care of the matter at hand.
[Azusa]: Be careful, Sensei.
[Azusa]: I can tell... She's strong.
[Mika]: Thanks for noticing! See, didn't I tell you last time, Sensei? I'm a lot tougher than I look.
[Mika]: All righty. Let's dispose of the Make-Up Work Club, then.
[Mika]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Mika]: Mika marvels at Sensei's refusal to surrender during the ensuing battle. She brings up how Azusa ambushed Seia in the past while preparing to crack down on the Make-Up Work Club,just in time for the Sisterhood to join the fray.
[Mika]: Geez. Now I get why all anyone ever talks about is Schale these days. Adults can be so meddlesome.
[Mika]: What an unexpected turn of events, but that's all right.
[Mika]: With Seia and Nagi out of the way, I can finally start doing things how I want. I would really appreciate you not interfering further.
[Hanako]: …!
[Mika]: More reinforcements will be here soon! Do you want to keep going?
[Hanako]: Mika! Was it you? Were you the one behind Seia's attack?
[Mika]: Huh?
[Mika]: You don't have to look at me with such disdain, you know.
[Mika]: Buuut...you're right: Iwas the one who orchestrated Seia's attack. What other choice did I have? Seia would prattle on every day about nonsense like paradise and whatnot.
[Mika]: Destroying her halo wasn't part of the plan, though. Give me a little credit—I'm not a murderer.
[Mika]: I was just going to keep her under lock and key until she graduated, but the raid team, rascals they were, let things get out of hand and went a little too far.
[Azusa]: …
[Mika]: Isn't that right, Azusa? You were part of the raid team that killed Seia, weren't you? Care to clear up this misunderstanding?
[Mika]: It's all because of that little mishap that things have gotten out of hand like this.
[Mika]: Get it? I can't turn back now because of that—because of you.
[Mika]: !
[Azusa]: I…
[Hifumi]: Azusa...? She isn't serious, right?
[Azusa]: N-No, that's not what…
[Azusa]: Explosion
[Mika]: Huh?
[Arius Student]: A group of students are breaching from the outside!
[Mika]: That's impossible. There shouldn't be any students left on campus who would dare oppose the Tea Party's orders.
[Hanako]: I can think of one. An independent organization that doesn't bow to the Tea Party or anyone else for that matter.
[Arius Student]: Status report. They're coming from the cathedral!
[Arius Student]: Fade to black
[Arius Student]: Footsteps
[Arius Student]: It’s the Sisterhood!
[Arius Student]: <<To be Continued>>
[Arius Student]: 18 - The Way of the World Part 2
[Arius Student]: The Sisterhood was called in by none other than Hanako. Now on the scene, Sakurako begins to battle Mika to rectify the situation.
[Mika]: The Sisterhood...?
[Mika]: Urawa Hanako!
[Hanako]: That's right. I did eventually decide to take someone up on their offer and made a pact of my own.
[Mika]: A pact?
[Hanako]: Nothing you need to concern yourself with. Besides…
[Hanako]: Black screen with explosions
[Mari]: *cough* May peace and comfort find you today.
[Hinata]: Apologies for barging in like this.
[Sakurako]: We've decided to break our customs and involve ourselves with the Tea Party's internal struggle.
[Sakurako]: Misono Mika of the Tea Party. You are under arrest for attempting and instigating harm to your fellow Tea Party members.
[Mika]: You must be Utazumi Sakurako of the Sisterhood.
[Mika]: Hahaha! This is my first time fighting the Sisterhood! So is this the trump card you've had up your sleeve?
[Mika]: Just how did you manage to get them involved, Hanako?
[Mika]: I knew you were acquainted with them at one point, just as you were with everyone. What did you offer in return, I wonder. These interlopers wouldn't lift a finger unless they stood to gain something from it.
[Hanako]: …
[Mika]: How intriguing, though I do find it annoying to have more pests to exterminate.
[Hanako]: Sounds to me like you're becoming restless, Mika.
[Mika]: I planned to clean out the cathedral when I became host anyway. This just saves me some time.
[Mika]: All right, everyone. Shall we get started?
[Mika]: Gun cocks
[Hanako]: Do you really intend to keep fighting?! It's pointless, Mika. Put down your weapon.
[Mika]: That may be true, but I can't simply surrender. Not after coming this far.
[Mika]: Fade to black
[Mika]: I'll stop at nothing.
[Mika]: <<Battle Sequence>>
[Mika]: Together, the Make-Up Work Club and the Sisterhood succeed in cornering Mika, who finally surrenders. Sensei lets Mika know that they'll be there for her if she ever needs someone on her—side. Mika is delighted to hear this and says farewell.
[Mika]: *sigh* Is this truly Checkmate?
[Mika]: Why? Why like this?
[Mika]: The Sisterhood didn't flinch even after Seia's death, yet they decide to get involved now. What a cruel joke.
[Mika]: Did I miss something? Overlook an important detail?
[Mika]: Or was it because I underestimated you, Hanako?
[Hanako]: …
[Mika]: No. Urawa Hanako is exceptional, but ultimately harmless. There was no need to account for her more than I did.
[Mika]: Could it have been because of Azusa's betrayal?
[Azusa]: …
[Mika]: No. She was only just a puppet. Whether she stayed loyal or not wouldn't have affected the outcome.
[Mika]: Perhaps Hifumi? No, she's just a normal girl. And Koharu is a fool, so there was no need to account for her.
[Mika]: Then why? Why did I lose to something like the Make-Up Work Club?
[Mika]: Where did it all go wrong?
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: Oh, I see. I overlooked the biggest variable of all.
[Mika]: Involving Schale and Sensei was the cause of my downfall.
[Mika]: It was only meant to be a precautionary measure. Nagi was making such a fuss about there being a traitor, and I thought it was a good solution... That's when my fate was sealed.
[Mika]: What a foolish mistake.
[Mika]: I suppose this is where it ends for me.
[Hanako]: Mika, about Seia…
[Mika]: As I told you, the intent was never to kill Seia. I may seem like a villain, but I'm not that evil.
[Mika]: It was an accident. Seia was weak to start off with and…
[Hanako]: Seia is alive, Mika!
[Mika]: …?!
[Hanako]: We just made it look like she died.
[Hanako]: She was secretly taken from Trinity and put into hiding as a precaution...since we couldn't find her assailant.
[Mika]: Seia...isn't dead?
[Hanako]: Her wounds haven't completely healed yet and she remains unconscious...but the head of the Remedial Knights continues to look after her.
[Mika]: Captain Mine?
[Hanako]: Yes. And the person who saved Seia was probably…
[Hanako]: …
[Hanako]: Never mind. I think you should ask her yourself.
[Mika]: I see. So she's still alive…
[Mika]: Black screen
[Mika]: That's wonderful news.
[Mika]: Gun drops
[Mika]: I surrender. You win.
[Mika]: Congratulations, Make-Up Work Club, Sensei... You've earned it.
[Mika]: Now, do whatever you want with me.
[Azusa]: …
[Mika]: You understand what the consequences of these actions will be for you, don't you, Azusa?
[Azusa]: Of course.
[Mika]: I hope you don't think Trinity will protect you.
[Mika]: You'll be hunted down no matter where you run. Forever.
[Mika]: There will never be another peaceful night's sleep.
[Mika]: There's no escaping Saori. You already know it all too well as someone from Arius: et omnia vanitas…
[Azusa]: I know. Still, I'll struggle until the bitter end—until I no longer can.
[Azusa]: …
[Mika]: Very well, then.
[Mika]: Mika being walked out by JTF members
[Sensei]: “Mika…”
[Mika]: Stop right there, Sensei. Don't say another word.
[Mika]: As I said, getting Schale involved was my greatest mistake.
[Mika]: And yet…
[Mika]: Flashback
[Sensei]: “I'll be by your side if you ever need me to be."
[Sensei]: Present
[Mika]: Hearing you say that made me truly happy. It really did.
[Mika]: IfI had made different choices, then maybe we…
[Mika]: No. Never mind.
[Mika]: Goodbye, Sensei.
[Mika]: Mika gets escorted out
[Mika]: <<To be Continued>>
[Mika]: 19 - The Third Exam
[Mika]: Having overcome numerous incidents and happenings, the Make-Up Work Club heads to the test site to sit for the third and final evaluation exam.
[Mika]: Birds chirping
[Hifumi]: U-Um…
[Hanako]: Is it finally over?
[Koharu]: I think so.
[Koharu]: Koharu stumbles
[Hifumi]: Koharu?!
[Koharu]: I-I nearly passed out there.
[Hanako]: I'm not surprised. We've been running around all night.
[Hifumi]: Not to mention how late we've been staying up for the last week to study.
[Azusa]: What are you all so relaxed for? It's not over yet.
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Hanako]: Oh.
[Hifumi]: Y-You're right! We still have to take our exam.
[Koharu]: I forgot about that…
[Azusa]: It's 7:50 right now.
[Azusa]: Which means we have just over an hour to get to the testing site. Let's run!
[Azusa]: Azusa whisks away
[Hifumi]: W-Wait! Will we make it all the way to the outskirts even if we run?!
[Hanako]: It's a long shot, but we won't know unless we try! Come on, ladies, let's get moving!
[Hanako]: Hanako whisks away
[Koharu]: But I can barely move my legs! Waaait!
[Hifumi]: *sigh* Why do things always turn out like this for us...?
[Hifumi]: Running
[Koharu]: *huff* *puff* Can't...go...any...further…
[Hifumi]: W-We made it…
[Justice Task Force Member]: We've been expecting you, Make-Up Work Club. I have a message from Vice President Hasumi.
[Justice Task Force Member]: She says, "Good luck."
[Hanako]: Well. then.
[Koharu]: H-Hasumi wished me luck...?
[Justice Task Force Member]: She also asked me to pass along how sorry she is for not being able to help this morning and promises to make it up to you.
[Azusa]: That's interesting.
[Sensei]: "Is everyone ready to head inside?"
[Sensei]: Door closes
[Azusa]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: …
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: "This is it. The third and final exam."
[Azusa]: Exactly. Everything is riding on this.
[Hanako]: You're right.
[Hifumi]: I'm pretty nervous.
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: We've been through so much together.
[Azusa]: That we have, but there will be more than enough time to get sentimental after we pass the exam.
[Hifumi]: Exactly. It's time to show how far we've come.
[Azusa]: Of course. I'm not aiming for anything below a perfect score.
[Hanako]: Neither am I. Anything less would be wasting everything I've learned from Azusa.
[Koharu]: I'm gonna score a 100! Just watch!
[Koharu]: Fade to white

[Hifumi]: 20 - Epilogue
[Hifumi]: Seia praises Sensei for overcoming the dangers, but warns that everything will eventually end in catastrophe. Finally, the Arius Squad goes on the move.
[Seia]: In the end, the Make-Up Work Club passed their exam completely on their own merits.
[Seia]: Now Koharu can return to the Justice Task Force.
[Seia]: Hanako seems to have found a place where she belongs, so she shouldn't have any reason to drop out of school.
[Seia]: Azusa has taken to the joy of learning.
[Seia]: And Hifumi, perhaps the most earnest and hard-working of the club, will be able to return to her normal life.
[Seia]: Mika has been locked away, maybe never to be seen again.
[Seia]: Nagisa's Eden Treaty will be signed as planned.
[Seia]: …
[Seia]: You could say everything has been wrapped up neatly with a little bow…
[Seia]: ...but the story isn't over yet.
[Seia]: You still have a responsibility to see it through to the end.
[Seia]: Rest assured that no matter how many twists or turns this story takes…
[Seia]: ...it will inevitably descend into catastrophe.
[Seia]: Seia steps closer
[Seia]: Do you see them on the horizon?
[Seia]: There are dark clouds coming—dark enough to blot out the sun. They may never clear.
[Seia]: Fade to black
[Seia]: It's not over yet. You know that better than anyone, don't you?
[Saori]: Prepare yourselves.
[Hiyori]: O-Oh, is it finally starting? It's going to be painful, right? It's definitely going to be painful.
[Misaki]: That's fine. Pain is proof that you are alive.
[Atsuko]: …
[Hiyori]: H-Hime is saying something in sign language. Um…
[Misaki]: "What happened to her?" You mean that one girl, Hime?
[Atsuko]: …
[Misaki]: What difference does it make? It was only a matter of time.
[Saori]: That's enough.
[Atsuko]: …
[Saori]: See those dark clouds? It's going to rain soon.
[Hiyori]: R-Rain? But I don't like rain. It's wet and cold and irritating...and it gets everywhere.
[Hiyori]: Fade to black
[Saori]: Struggle as much as you like, Azusa, but you can't escape.
[Saori]: The truth is ingrained into your very being, and you will be reminded of it soon enough.
[Saori]: It is the prophecy.
[Saori]: All is in vain. Life is ultimately empty.
[Saori]: <<To be Continued>>
