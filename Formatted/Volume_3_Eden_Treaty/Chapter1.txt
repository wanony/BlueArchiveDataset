[Volume 3]: Eden Treaty
[Chapter 1]: Make-Up Work Club, Here We Go!
[Chapter 1]: Save the troubled youth of Trinity who are at risk of failing out. Take charge of the Make-Up Work Club and lead your students to success!
[Chapter 1]: Episode 01- Prologue
[Chapter 1]: We enter the scene where a lone girl speaks to Sensei. They are in Trinity Terrace. The cityscape outside the window indicates that it is nighttime.
[Seia]: The Eden Treaty is a promise to put an end to hatred, so to speak. It’s a pact to cease the long-standing rivalry between Trinity and Gehenna. In other words, it’s an effort to build trust in the place of hatred that would only continue to fester if left alone. You can think of it as a peace treaty between Gehenna and Trinity. However, now that the General Student Council president has gone missing, the pact is worthless. Eden is the name of the paradise from ancient scriptures. It’s beyond me why the General Student Council president chose it to begin with. Perhaps it was because she had a sick sense of humor.
[Seia]: The night sky of Kivotos is on full display. The stars shine brightly and so do the halos above the city.
[Seia]: Are you aware of Kivotos’ seven koans? The fifth one relates to paradise.
[Seia]: “Can we prove anyone has ever reached paradise?”
[Seia]: Like each of the koans, this question’s intent is vague, but it can be interpreted as referring to the inherent paradox in proving the existence of paradise. If paradise exists, then the ones who reach it will remain there for eternity, forever enveloped in joy and satisfaction. If someone does leave paradise, it’s because they weren’t fully satisfied, so it was never a paradise for them. Therefore, those who reach paradise cannot be found-and should not exist-outside of paradise.
[Seia]: The screen transitions to a shot of Trinity campus at night.
[Seia]: So, can you prove the truth of someone who does not exist? The purpose of this fifth koan is to be nigh unanswerable. Does truth that cannot be proven become worthless? What is the true question masked behind such cynicism? Eden is the paradise from scripture. It exists nowhere and cannot be found.
[Seia]: The screen transitions into pure black.
[Seia]: In other words, it’s nothing but a sweet illusion conjured by dreamers. You see? Surely, this is the metaphor behind the treaty’s name.
[Seia]: Once again we are brought back to the Terrace with Seia.
[Seia]: Sensei. You may find the story that’s about to unfold to be unpalatable. It’s a story meant to make you uncomfortable, uneasy, and leave you unhappy. A cynical story that will make you doubt people and truth. Gloomy, sad, painful, and ultimately bitter. But entirely truthful. I ask that you not look away and see it through to the end. For that is your responsibility.
[Seia]: A series of images transition one into another.
[Seia]: The first scene is a wide shot of Trinity Terrace, but this time it is midday and two people are seated. The POV fades into an image of a contemplating Nagisa.
[Seia]: The second scene is of Hina inside a vehicle as she looks out, also in what seems to be in contemplation.
[Seia]: Azusa leans against a wall in a classroom at either dawn or sunset, the clocktower of Trinity jutting to the sky.
[Seia]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Episode 2]: Make-Up Work Club
[Episode 2]: We are in a classroom that has Peroro drawn on the board and some plushies on a table.
[Koharu]: I can’t stand it anymore! I’m in agony! Torment! Misery! A-And it’s all your fault, Sensei!
[Sensei]: “Me?”
[Hanako]: You’re going to hurt Sensei’s feelings if you keep saying things like that, Koharu. Keep in mind that Sensei is only here to help us…Besides, it isn’t their fault that you failed that exam.
[Kohari]: ...! I’m a member of the Justice Task Force! It’s not my fault I have to miss so many classes!
[Azusa]: Strange. The same applies to the other Justice Task Force members, yet you’re the only one who failed, Koharu.
[Koharu]: ...
[Hanako]: Goodness, Azusa. Are you trying to tell Koharu that she isn’t intelligent?
[Azusa]: You can interpret it that way, but the reality is that sometimes life is just like this.
[Hanako]: You mean that life is agony, torment, and misery like she said? That’s deep.
[Koharu]: Wh-why am I the one being singled out?! You all failed too! If I’m dumb, then so are all of you!
[Hifumi]: A-Ahaha…You guys…
[Koharu]: Idiots- the whole lot of you! That’s why you’re all in the Make-Up Work Club to begin with! You! And you! And YOU! And you too!
[Sensei]: “What did I do?!”
[Hifumi]: Okay, Koharu. Deep breaths. Calm down.
[Koharu]: Calm down?! We’re all going to be expelled! And if I’m expelled, I’ll be kicked out of the Justice Task Force. Anything but that…
[Azusa]: I can at least sympathize on that front. Expulsion is not an option. I won’t go down without a fight, no matter how futile it may seem.
[Hanako]: Haha. I dunno. Getting expelled doesn’t seem like the end of the world. Rather…
[Hifumi]: Excuse me?!
[Azusa]: ...
[Koharu]: ...
[Hanako]: ...
[Hifumi]: S-Sorry for yelling. What I meant to say is, we’re all here to make sure it doesn’t come to that. But if we don’t start putting out heads together…we’ll all be expelled in a week.
[Hanako]: I think this needs something more than a cliche like “put our heads together” to solve. What if we thought outside the box instead? What if we thought outside the box? Something like…”Let’s put our bodies together!”
[Koharu]: Get your head out of the gutter, you perv, or I’ll blow it off myself! Can you even hear yourself? That doesn’t even make sense!
[Hanako]: My, you don’t have a very active imagination, do you Koharu? We could always try it out together.
[Hanako]: Hanako slowly approaches Koharu one step at a time.
[Koharu]: Wh…WHAT?! Back it up! P-Personal space! I don’t wanna know!
[Hanako]: Here I come!
[Koharu]: No, let me go! Save me, Sensei! I’m sorry! I’m sorry…! I’m sorry I snapped at you Just let me go already!
[Azusa]: Fascinating. I’ve never seen such an effective restraining method in close-quarters combat. This will prove most useful. But I would’ve twisted her joints first. You made too many unnecessary moves with your hands.
[Hifumi]: ...Sensei…Please…
[Sensei]: “I’ll try, Hifumi, but no promises.”
[Hifumi]: Please do what you can. We’re all going to be expelled at this rate…
[Hifumi]: The screen turns black
[Hifumi]: (A few weeks earlier.)
[Hifumi]: We are inside Trinity Terrace.
[Nagisa]: Hello, [NAME] Sensei. It’s good to meet you. I’m kirifuji Nagisa, the host of the Tea Party. And this is Misono Mika, a member of the Tea Party like myself. Trinity’s Tea Party hereby welcomes the sensei of Schale.
[Nagisa]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Nagisa]: Episode 03- Tea Party
[Nagisa]: This is an immediate continuation of the last episode.
[Mika]: I’ve been wondering what you might look like, Sensei. You don't look all that different from us. I think I like you, Sensei! What do you think, Nagisa?
[Nagisa]: I don’t believe it’s polite to comment on such things in front of Sensei, Mika. There’s no shame in affection, but there’s a proper time and place for it.
[Mika]: Oh. Is that how it works? Sorry, Sensei. I guess I was being too informal. I guess I should say something like…I’m pleased to meet you!
[Sensei]: “Well it’s nice to meet you too.”
[Nagisa]: …
[Mika]: Heehee.
[Ngisa]: If memory serves, you’re the first person outside of Trinity to be invited to the Tea Party. This is normally a place that ordinary students could scarcely hope to be invited to.
[Mika]: Sheesh, Nagi! Don’t make such a big deal out of it!
[Nagisa]: … *sigh* That wasn’t my intentions, Mika.
[Mika]: Right. My bad. I’ll keep a lid on it.
[Nagisa]: …We brought you here because we have a small favor to ask.
[Sensei]: “And what’s that?”
[Mika]: Hold on Nagi. Are we really going straight to the point?! Shouldn’t we, like, make small talk or something? Chat a bit to break the ice? We could talk about how great the weather is or what we ate yesterday. Should we really be skipping all that? Isn’t the Tea Party supposed to be all about social gathering?
[Nagisa]: …
[Mika]: You can stare at me with those pretty eyes all you want, but I’m not backing down. This has to do with proper Tea Party etiquette!
[Nagisa]: You’re more than welcome to uphold those values when you’re the host, Mika. I am the host at the moment, so you will be following my lead.
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: …Forgive me. It’s unsightly of us to quarrel in front of a guest. Why don’t we change the subject as Mika suggested?
[Nagisa]: Sensei “You all act as Trinity’s Student Council Presidents, right?”
[Mika]: Whoa, Sensei can really read the room! Take a good look, Nagi. Those are some grownup conversational skills. Listen to the eloquence and flow!
[Nagisa]: …ignoring that, yes, you are correct, Sensei. We are the Student Council presidents of Trinity. You might be wondering why there are multiple presidents. It’s a tradition of Trinity’s Student Council to have multiple presidents serve simultaneously.
[Mika]: Hey! Why did you ignore me, Nagi?
[Nagisa]: Before Trinity was unified, the representatives of each branch academy would hold tea parties to resolve any disputes…
[Mika]: Are you really doing this? That’s so mean. My feelings…
[Nagisa]: The representatives of the Pater, Fillius, and Sanctus academies came together to hold tea parties meant to create an atmosphere of reconciliation, and since then…
[Mika]: You’re just straight up-ignoring me, Nagi. Are you doing this to get back at me? You’re the worst. Is this how you treat a friend that you’ve known for over ten years?
[Nagisa]: …the student Council of Trinity has been called the Tea Party, and the representatives of each faction host-Will you shut up?!
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: I’m in the middle of something! Can you not keep your mouth shut?! Mika! On and on and on! If you don’t shut that little yapper of yours…I’ll stuff it shut for you with a cake roll!
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: …
[Sensei]: “…”
[Nagisa]: …Pardon me. I don’t know what came over me. *exhale* My apologies, Mika. Sensei.
[Mika]: S-So scary…
[Sensei]: (Please just let them get to the point already)
[Nagisa]: What we’re requesting of you is rather simple, Sensei.
[Mika]: Yeah, simple but important.
[Nagisa]: Very important. Could you take charge of the Make-Up Work Club?
[Sensei]: “Make -Up Work Club?”
[Nagisa]: Yes. To put it plainly, we want you to operate a special class meant to save failing students. Trinity is an academic institution with a long history of intellectual and martial excellence. But somehow, this proud institution has no less than four failing students.
[Mika]: Yup. We’ve got a lot on our plates now. Things are pretty disorganized due to the Eden Treaty. We need to deal with these failing students pronto, but we’re short on manpower and time…That’s when we read this! An article about all the amazing things Schale has been doing! Finding cats, cleaning streets, delivering packages-Schale may just be the greatest errand runners Kivotos has ever seen! There was someone we could switch with all of our most tedious work right under our noses! You’re our savior!
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: I wouldn’t go quite that far, Mika…
[Mika]: Why not? That’s what we’re doing, isn’t it? Besides, you’re a teacher, Sensei. These days, lectures are held on Blu-ray discs. While we still have faculty members, administration, guest lecturers, and associate professors, a regular old teacher is pretty rare. A teacher is someone who uses their own knowledge to guide others, right? In other words, a leader. In that sense, a teacher is also someone who commands respect and gives others direction in life. That sounds perfect for the Make-Up Work Club.
[Nagisa]: Yes, but I’ve heard Sensei here isn’t quite someone I’d consult with about my direction in life…
[Mika]: Haha. I feel you. We’ve heard a lot of stories about you. I’ll save you the embarrassment of repeating what we’ve heard.
[Mika]: Sensei
[Mika]: (What kind of reports are they getting?!)
[Mika]: (I don’t even want to know…)
[Mika]: No difference in dialogue choice
[Mika]: Anyway! We’re in a bit of a jam, so you taking care of this would be great!
[Nagisa]: The Make-Up Work Club will be a special club intended to give failing students the help they need. Given it’s being made under the current restrictions, Schales extrajudicial authority will be necessary to have it established. It’s a necessary expenditure if it’s to help failing students. What do you say, Sensei? Surely you wouldn’t turn away students in need…
[Sensei]: “I won’t refuse if it means helping students who need me.”
[Mika]: Yes, we did it! Thank you, Sensei!
[Nagisa]: …Very well. I didn’t necessarily expect you to decline our request, but…Never mind. Just take a look at this document.
[Sensei]: (Take the List)
[Nagisa]: These are the students.
[Mika]: Yup. Each one a thorn in Trinity’s side, so to speak.
[Nagisa]: You could put it more tactfully than that, Mika. We’ll put it this way: These are the students in need of Trinity’s love.
[Mika]: Sure, whatever.
[Sensei]: (Wait a minute…!)
[Mika]: Hmm? Do you recognize any of the students, Sensei?
[Sensei]: 
[Sensei]: “Um, no…”
[Sensei]: (Answer vaguely)
[Sensei]: No difference in dialogue choice.
[Nagisa]: We’ll send you some documents with all the details. Do you have any other questions?
[Sensei]: “What’s the Eden Treaty?”
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: …
[Mika]: Hmm…that’s a toughie.
[Nagisa]: It is quite a long story, so we’ll set aside some time for that at a later date. The information is classified after all. Regardless, it doesn’t concern your work with the Make-Up Work Club.
[Sensei]: “Shouldn’t the Tea Party have three Student Council presidents?”
[Mika]: …
[Nagisa]: Well, yes, but…
[Mika]: Seia isn’t at Trinity right now. She’s taken ill.
[Nagisa]: Correct. Seia is supposed to be the one hosting this party, but…since she’s absent, I’m hosting in her place.
[Mika]: We all take turns acting as the Tea Party’s host. Though that also isn’t any of your concern.
[Sensei]: “I guess that’s it then…”
[Nagisa]: Splendid. You can officially work for Trinity once preparations are complete. Once again, we appreciate your assistance. This will be a great help to us.
[Mika]: Bye, Sensei! See you next time. Hopefully.
[Nagisa]: It’s actually unusual for every Tea Party host to be gathered in one place.
[Mika]: Oh, don’t act like we’re always busy. Still, this meeting with Sensei is the first time I’ve seen your face in a while. It’s nice.
[Nagisa]: I feel the same way, Mika.
[Mika]: Heehee.
[Nagisa]: We’ll be counting on you, Sensei. I will be escorting you from this point forward as the host of the Tea Party.
[Sensei]: “Well, it’s nice to meet you too.”
[Sensei]: (I decided to see a student whose name I recognized on the list for the Make-Up Work Club.)
[Sensei]: “It really is you!”
[Hifumi]: A-haha…Hi, Sensei. I can explain everything. Well…
[Hifumi]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hifumi]: Episode 04- Failing Students Part 1
[Hifumi]: This is an immediate continuation of the last episode.
[Hifumi]: So, th-the thing is...it’s not my fault. There was a surprise Peroro show, and I had to skip my regular exam to attend. S-so that’s why I’m failing now.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hifumi]: …Don’t look at me like that! I was sure that I checked the exam date, but I must have made a mistake..Yeah…I’m sorry…
[Sensei]: “I’m not sure you have anything to apologize for.”
[Hifumi]: R-Right. So what happened was…Nagisa asked me to support you, Sensei.
[Hifumi]: The scene transitions to a flashback at the dining area at night.
[Nagisa]: That’s where the matter stands. Will you help Sensei lead the Make-Up Work Club, Hifumi?
[Hifumi]: What?! M-Me?!
[Nagisa]: Yes. This is a responsibility that only an honor student such as yourself can handle.
[Hifumi]: I-I’m not an honor student. My grades have always been average…and that was before I started failing.
[Nagisa]: Haha. I’ve always found you to be rather compassionate. Besides, isn't it time you repaid your debt to me?
[Hifumi]: Well…
[Nagisa]: Haha. I take that to mean that you agree. I’m counting on you, my Make-Up Work Club President.
[Nagisa]: We return to Hifumi and Sensei into the classroom
[Sensei]: “You’re the club president?!”
[Hifumi]: I-it’s just a temporary title. The Make-Up Work Club is only a provisional club. We’ll be disbanded once everyone raises their grades back up. B-But until then, I’ll be working with you, Sensei.
[Sensei]: “Looking forward to it, Hifumi.”
[Hifumi]: “I’m glad you’re here. I don’t know what I’d do otherwise…Oh, have you met the other Make-Up Work Club members? There should be three others. I checked the list to see who they are. Let’s go meet them, Sensei. We’ll have our handles full with teaching and coming up with a plan to prevent them from failing.
[Sensei]: (Follow Hifumi)
[Location Tag]: Justice Task Force HQ
[Sensei]: “Wait. Isn’t this…?”
[Hifumi]: Oh, no. I never enjoy having to come here. Hello…Is anyone here? Hello?
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: H-Hello.
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: E-Excuse me…
[Koharu]: What?
[Hifumi]: W-Well, I’m, uh…
[Koharu]: ...
[Hifumi]: Are we being ignored…?
[Sensei]: “Maybe she’s shy.”
[Koharu]: W-Who are you calling shy?! I’m just wary of strangers!
[Sensei]: “Yeah, they call that being shy.”
[Koharu]: …What brings you to the Justice Task Force?
[Hifumi]: U-Um…we’re here to find someone.
[Koharu]: What?! You think it’s the Justice Task Force’s job to find missing people? This ain't the place for that. We don’t do volunteer work.
[Hifumi]: Th-That’s not what we mean. We heard the person we’re looking for is being detained here. They’re locked up?
[Hifumi]: F-For…disorderly conduct. So, um…
[Koharu]: Huh?
[Koharu]: A pink-haired woman wearing a school swimsuit suddenly appears.
[Hanako]: Are you here for me?
[Koharu]: …?!
[Hifumi]: …?!
[Sensei]: “...?!”
[Koharu]: Wh-What the heck?! How did you get out of your cell? I could have sworn I locked it tight!
[Hanako]: You didn’t mean to leave it open, then? I walked right through when I heard what sounded like someone looking for me. Can I help you? I didn’t expect to see a teacher here. You must be the one in charge of the Make-Up Work Club, yes?
[Koharu]: S-Stop making pleasantries and go get dressed! Who walks around in their swimsuit, you weirdo?!
[The screen goes black except to show Hanako. Her full name appears beside her. The textbox states]: 
[“Second-year from the Make-Up Work Club]: Urawa Hanako. Arrested for strolling around campus in her school swimsuit. Currently in the custody of the Justice Task Force.”
[Hanako]: Hmm? Is there a problem, Miss Shimoe?
[Koharu]: Y-You can’t wear a swimsuit on school grounds! That’s common sense!
[Hanako]: Hmm? But the school swimming pool is on school grounds as well…Do you prefer to swim without a swimsuit,Miss Shimoe?
[Koharu]: Huh? What kind of…?
[Hanako]: I never expected you to be the kind to skinny dip. Then again, I have heard that the Justice Task Force likes to lead by example.
[Koharu]: Don’t be ridiculous! Who said anything about a matter of preference?!
[Hanako]: Are we insisting that nudism is the only acceptable lifestyle? How avant-garde. Radical, certainly, but perhaps worth exploring…
[Koharu]: Would you get back in your cell already?! My seniors will be here any minute!
[Hanako]: Oh, my. Are they all coming to get a peep at me as well?
[Koharu]: Shut up! Shut up! Just get in there!
[Hanako]: Ta-ta, everyone. I’m a little preoccupied, so you’ll have to see me some other time.
[Hanako]: Koharu and Hanako both leave.
[Hifumi]: 
[Sensei]: “...”
[Sensei]: Koharu returns
[Koharu]: *pant* *pant*
[Hifumi]: Um, so…what will happen to Hanako now?
[Koharu]: Isn’t it obvious?! The penalty for indecency is death! Summary execution!
[Hifumi]: I-I don’t think you have to go that far…
[Koharu]: She was talking around school grounds in a swimsuit! In the middle of the day! In a plaza full of people!
[Hanako]: I don’t understand. I know we have a dress code, so that’s why I chose to wear my school swimsuit.
[Koharu]: Why wouldn’t you wear your normal uniform?!
[Hifumi]: Oh, dear. It’s going to be difficult to talk to Hanako like this.Why don’t we go meet the next member? Um let’s see. The next member is…Shirasu Azusa.
[Hifumi]: The click of a door handle is heard
[Hasumi]: We’ve returned.
[Mashiro]: Mission accomplished! Shirasu Azusa has been successfully apprehended!
[Hifumi]: What?! No way!
[Koharu]: Oh, you’re back, Hasumi. Mashiro.
[Mashiro]: Thank you for keeping watch, Koharu…wait…
[Hasumi]: Sensei?
[Hasumi]: Azusa appears wearing her gasmask
[Azusa]: *inhale**exhale*
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: “...”
[Azusa]: A shame. I could’ve gotten at least three more of them if I hadn’t run out of ammo. Do your worst. I’ve been trained to withstand any kind of torture, so you won’t be getting anything out of me. *inhale**exhale*
[The screen goes black with only Azusa appearing. Her name appears next to her and the textbox states]: 
[“Second-year from the Make-Up Work Club]: Shirasu Azusa. She occupied a tear gas storage area while being pursued for commiting violent acts on school grounds. Proceeded to use tear gas to resist arrest for three hours before the Justice Task Force finally apprehended her. Evaded capture by laying traps and IEDs until the moment of her arrest.”
[“Second-year from the Make-Up Work Club]: <<To be Continued…>>
[“Second-year from the Make-Up Work Club]: Episode 05- Failing Students part 2
[“Second-year from the Make-Up Work Club]: Hasumi closes a door and then speaks.
[Hasumi]: Yes, I heard you will be the one in charge of the Make-Up Work Club for the time being. I imagine that you’ll be very bust, Sensei. I apologize that we can’t offer any help.
[Sensei]: “Actually, you can. I want you to turn those two over to me.”
[Koharu]: Never! On what grounds?! They’re shameless criminals!
[Hasumi]: Settle down, Koharu. The Tea Party contacted Schale specifically to request Sensei’s help. Those two fall under Sensei’s jurisdiction as the one in charge of the Make-Up Work club. Those are the rules.
[Koharu]: “B-But…Fine. If you say so. Hmph! Well it serves them right! What better punishment than being lumped into a Make-Up Work Club! How humiliating! Hahaha! A team of degenerates and outcasts! I would die of shame if I was forced to join a club like that!
[Hasumi]: *sigh* Koharu…
[Hifumi]: “Um…
[Sensei]: “There’s only one left, right?”
[Hifumi]: Y-Yes, that’s right. I should have spoken up sooner, because the thing is the last club member is Shimoe…Ko…haru.
[Koharu]: …Me?
[The screen goes black as Koharu is the only focus. Her full name appears next to her and the textbox reads]: 
[“First-year from Make-Up Work Club]: Shimoe Koharu. On the verge of flunking after three consecutive F’s. Note: Cannot return to the Justice Task Force until she is no longer failing.”
[“First-year from Make-Up Work Club]: The scene then transitions with a sudden jump cut to a trinity classroom. Hanako is in her swimsuit and Azusa is wearing her gas mask.
[Hanako]: Oh, so these are the other members of the Make-Up Work Club?
[Azusa]: *inhale**exhale**
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: A-Ahaha…Well, here we are, everyone. This is the Make-Up Work Club. Th-The real challenge starts now.
[Hanako]: What do we do now, President Ajitani? A group of young girls, alone with someone far more experienced in a secluded classroom after school…My, how scandalous.
[Azusa]: *exhale* I’m not sure what you’re suggesting, but I couldn’t care less. I have enough resources for us to take shelter here for a month if need be.
[Koharu]: Someone please kill me.
[Hifumi]: …Sensei…A little help?
[Sensei]: “I’ll do what I can.”
[Hifumi]: Thanks. I’ll try my best too.
[Hifumi]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hifumi]: Episode 06- Breaking the Ice
[Location Tag]: Make-Up Work Club Classroom
[Location Tag]: (The Make-Up Work Club members briefly introduced themselves.)
[Hifumi]: That’s the long and short of the situation. This is just a temporary arrangement, but let’s try to make the most of it.
[Sensei]: “It’s a pleasure to meet you all.”
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: Are there, uh…any questions?
[Azusa]: None. We’re to do special afterschool training in addition to our regular classes. It’s simple to understand.
[Hifumi]: Basically. The goal is for each of us to pass the special academic evaluation exam that’s coming up…W-We don’t necessarily have to ace it or anything-we just have to not fail is all…Sensei will do everything to help us too. We’ll also get three attempts at the exam. But if we pass the first one, we won’t have to take it again. That means our make-up work would end early! Sensei’s role will be to manage and supervise us while checking our schedules. We can also turn to Sensei for supplemental lessons to our regular classes.
[Azusa]: Understood. Our objective is to complete this mission together. We must gather here every day to train in order to do so. Essentially, this is a gathering of people trying to avoid dishonorable discharge. I see no reason to sabotage this arrangement.
[Hifumi]: Exactly! Oh, come to think of it…you transferred here not very long ago, isn’t that right, Azusa? You must still be getting used to the academy. If you work hard with Sensei, you’ll finish your make-up work in no time.
[Hanako]: Oh? Is Miss Shirasi a transfer student? It’s rare for someone to transfer into Trinity…
[Azusa]: …
[Hifumi]: Well, at least that’s what your file said…Oh, no. Did you not want to share that?
[Azusa]: No, there’s no point in hiding the truth. Don’t worry about it. Adapting is merely a matter of putting in the appropriate work.
[Hanako]: Hmm…You wouldn’t mind me calling you Azusa, would you?
[Azusa]: No? Why would I mind?
[Hanako]: Wonderful! My clubmates Azusa, Hifumi, and Koharu. I like the sound of that. We’re soldiers fighting in the trenches that is make-up work. You may act like an ice queen, Azusa, but I can tell you have a sweet side. Heehee.
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: This can’t be right. Koharu’s eyes look like they’re filled with hate for some reason!
[Koharu]: You all…What did I do to deserve this? I refuse to accept it!
[Koharu]: Hifumi Wh-Wha…?
[Hanako]: Refuse to accept what?
[Koharu]: I-I’m an elite member of the Justice Task Force! D-Don’t you dare look down on me just because I’m the only first-year! I’ll be out of this stupid Make-Up Work Club before you know, so don’t get too friendly!
[Hanako]: Hmm. You have a point. I don’t see the need for us to treat each other any differently based on class year. I’m okay with that.
[Azusa]: That works for me too. I’m not used to that kind of culture anyway. Besides, We’re each here for our own benefit, so I don’t see the need to pretend to be friends.
[Hifumi]: Well…
[Koharu]: Great! Truth is, I’ve actually been keeping  a secret from you all…The reason I’ve been failing recently is because I was taking the second-year exam so I could skip a grade!
[Hanako]: Skip a grade? Why would you want to do that?
[Koharu]: Why?! Because I’m going to become the Justice Task Force’s ace!
[Hanako]: Um, but that’s how you failed, isn’t it? I could understand trying it once, but why continue doing it after failing?
[Koharu]: Sh-Shut up! That’s not what’s important! The point is that I’ve been hiding my true power. This time, I’ll take the first-year exam! I’m sure to earn an excellent award, aren’t I? After that, it’s farewell to the Make-Up Work Club!
[Hifumi]: No one said anything about being done with make-up work if you win an excellence award…
[Azusa]: You were holding back? I see. Just so you know, I’ll be taking the first-year exam as well.
[Koharu]: Wh-Who cares? I’m done with the Make-Up Work Club after the next exam! See you later, it was nice knowing you-that’s all I’m trying to say! I have it all figured out, so pretend like I was never here! Bye! Ahahaha! And good luck!
[Koharu]: Koharu leaves
[Hifumi]: Sh-she really left…
[Hanako]: Aren’t Koharu’s little mood swings the cutest? On the other hand, it’s adorable how Azusa never changes.
[Hifumi]: Um…
[Hanako]: I think I’m going to like it here. Heehee.

[The screen goes black and a textbox appears stating]: (Afterschool study hall.)
[Azusa]: I don’t understand this question, Hanako.
[Hanako]: Hmm? This problem is about prime factorization. You can use divisibility rules here. All you have to do is…
[Azusa]: Hmm. I see.
[Hifumi]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: Hmm? Are you stuck on something, Koharu?
[Koharu]: N-No! Of course not!
[Hanako]: FYI, the page you’re on right now won’t be on the exam.
[Koharu]: I-It won’t be?! I k-I knew that! I-I was just getting ahead, that’s all!
[Hifumi]: …
[Azusa]: I don’t understand the meaning of this sentence, Hanako.
[Hanako]: It’s the first verse of an ancient epic. It translates to, “O goddess of poetry, sing a song of rage.”
[Azua]: Ah, that one. I understand.
[Hifumi]: …
[Azusa]: …Hanako, this one…
[Hanako]: That’s a translation of an ancient language. Hold on a second. Let me grab a dictionary so we can understand it better.
[Azusa]: Oh, in that case, I think I’ve got it. Gaudium et spes…Joy and hope, I think.
[Hanako]: Correct. That’s the slogan of the second council. More importantly, can you read that language, Azusa?
[Azusa]: Yeah. I learned a long time ago.
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: “This is going well.”
[Hifumi]: Isn’t it? Hanako seems to have a real knack for tutoring! And Azusa has a real will to learn! If Koharu told us the truth about hiding her full potential…then, I have a feeling that the exams will be a breeze! What a relief. To be honest, I was really worried…In fact, the Tea Party gave me an order to start a boot camp for the second exam if any of us fails the first one.
[Sensei]: “Boot camp?”
[Hifumi]: Yes. That’s how far they’re taking things. If anyone fails at three exams…
[Sensei]: “What exactly would that entail?”
[Hifumi]: N-Nothing! I don’t think we have to worry about that, so let’s not jinx it. At the rate things are going, the exams should be no problem! By the way, could Hanako have failed by missing the exams like I did? I mean, she seems so good at studying. I don’t know how else she could have failed…
[Hifumi]: The day of the First Special Academic Evaluation Exam
[Koharu]: …
[Hifumi]: Hmm…
[Hanako]: Heehee.
[Azusa]: …
[Sensei]: “Good luck on the first exam, everyone.”
[Koharu]: I don’t need luck. I’ll show you what it means to be elite, just you watch!
[Hifumi]: A-Ahaha…
[Hanako]: Here goes nothing. Heehee.
[Azusa]: Understood. All preparations are complete.
[Azusa]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Azusa]: Episode 08- The First Evaluation Exam
[Azusa]: We are shown a classroom midday as the four members of the Make-Up Work Club are taking their exam. Hifumi, Azusa, and Koharu are in deep thought as they take their exam. Hanako, on the other hand, seems relaxed.
[Hifumi]: (Thank goodness these are all questions we covered in our make-up work! The problems we studied with Sensei and the parts we went over together are exactly the same! This exam should be easy for all of us! Could they have designated it to give the Make-Up Work Club a break? Even though they were threatening to send us to boot camp, they really came through for us…)
[Koharu]: *grun* This is…Um…
[Hanako]: Heehee.
[Azusa]: *scratch**scratch*
[Hifumi]: (That’s it, everyone! The finish line is within sight! Pass this test and we can all graduate from the Make-Up Work Club with smiles on our faces.)
[Hifumi]: The scene slowly fades to black and returns us to the classroom used by the Make-Up Work Club earlier.
[Hifumi]: The scores have been calculated.
[Hifumi]: Good work, everyone. You just have to score a 60 out of 100 or better. Everything is fine as long as you didn’t fail, and this test was practically a warm up. Please tell us the test results, Sensei. We’re ready whenever you are!
[Hifumi]: Announce the results.
[Hifumi]: 72
[Result]: Pass
[Hifumi]: I did it! Next up is…
[Azusa]: 32.
[Result]: Fail.
[Hifumi]: What?!
[Azusa]: Hmph. So close.
[Hifumi]: H-Hold on! That’s barely even halfway to passing! Th-This was supposed to be an easy test!
[Koharu]: 11.
[Result]: Fail.
[Koharu]: …?!
[Hifumi]: Wait just a minute! Wha-What happened to holding back, and unlocking your true potential?! Are you sure you took the first-year exam this time, Koharu?! You didn’t take the second-year one again-or maybe the third -year exam?!
[Koharu]: I-I can explain! The test was really hard…
[Hifumi]: No it wasn’t! It was supposed to be easy!
[Hanako]: Oh my…
[Hifumi]: What are we going to do, Hanako? Even if the two of us passed…we’ll still have no choice but to take the second exam.
[Hanako]: 2.
[Result]: Fail.
[Hifumi]: A TWO?! Two! Did I hear that right? Is that grade even possible? What happened, Hanako?! You looked like you were in your element while studying!
[Hanako]: I’ve been told I give off that vibe, but that doesn’t mean I get good grades/
[Hifumi]: Vibe?! Just a vibe?! It has nothing to do with your grades?! Oh…No…
[Sense]: “Stay with us, Hifumi!”
[The scene transitions to the classroom at sunset as text appears in the center]: 
[The scene transitions to the classroom at sunset as text appears in the center]: First Evaluation Exam Results
[Hanako]: Failed
[Azusa]: Failed
[Koharu]: Failed
[Hifumi]: Passed
[Hifumi]: The Make-Up Work Club is going to boot camp!
[Hifumi]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hifumi]: Episode 09- What Lurks in the Depths
[Hifumi]: The scene starts at Trinity Terrace at night. Sensei approaches Nagisa.
[Nagisa]: Welcome, Sensei. How good of you to join me. How are you and the Make-Up Work Club faring? …Yes, I heard the news. It sounds like the first exam didn’t go so well. There are still two exams left, however. Oh…this? I was playing a game of chess. It’s a hobby of mine.
[Sensei]: Examine Nagisa’s chess board.
[Nagisa]: Is something wrong? Aside from the pawns, the black side has only a king and queen, whereas the white has three or four of each of kings, rooks, bishops, and knights. I’m sure this game must look strange to you.
[Sensei]: “Were you playing by yourself?”
[Nagisa]: Yes, it’s just me at the moment. Mika isn’t here to cause her usual distractions. I’ve been waiting here by myself to speak with you. Though it would seem there’s something you would like to ask first.
[Sensei]: “What happens to the Make-Up Work Club if someone fails all three exams?”
[Nagisa]: …So you heard about that. Hifumi must have told you. She’s soft-hearted when it comes to such things, though that is one of her commendable qualities. Nothing out of the ordinary would happen. There is only one course that can be taken after repeated academic failure: Everyone in the Make-Up Work Club will be expelled.
[Sensei]: “Expelled?!”
[Nagisa]: It’s only natural that Trinity have regulations regarding failure, suspension, and expulsion. The steps in doing so are long and arduous. Unlike Gehenna, Trinity follows procedure. The Make-Up Work Club, however, was created using a loophole that gets around those rules. It was thanks to Schale’s authority that it was established. After all, the Make-Up Work Club’s true purpose…is to expel students.
[Sensei]: “...?!”
[Sensei]: “Why would you do that?!”
[Nagisa]: …Because among them is someone who would seek to betray Trinity.
[Sensei]: “There’s a traitor?”
[Sensei]: The screen fades to black as Nagisa continues speaking.
[Nagisa]: This traitor seeks to prevent the Eden Treaty from being signed. I suppose it’s time I explain the treaty so that you might understand the gravity of the situation.
[Nagisa]: File envelopes are shown. At the top are the logos for the Tea Party and the Pandamonium Society, below them on another line is “Eden Treaty” TOP SECRET
[Nagisa]: The Eden Treaty, simply put, is a non-aggression pact between Trinity and Gehenna. Its main purpose is to establish a neutral treaty organization composed of key figures from both Gehenna and Trinity. This organization, named the Eden Treaty Organization, will automatically intervene and resolve any conflict that breaks out between Trinity and Gehenna. This will prevent all-out war between the two academies- for if one flounders, then both will sink together.
[Nagisa]: The scene returns back to Trinity Terrace
[Nagisa]: Sensei. The lasting hostility between Trinity and Gehenna has been a great burden to both parties.  The Eden Treaty is the only way to put an end to the needless hostility and keep the balance of power in Kivotos. This solution was suggested by the General Student Council president. It had fallen by the wayside once she went missing, but I’ve been able to restore its momentum. And now, just as we’re preparing to finally sign the treaty, we receive intelligence that there are people planning to sabotage it. That said, we don’t know who she is. That’s why our next best option was to gather every suspect in one place. But rest assured: She is among them. We would have had to dispose of the entire apple cart to rid ourselves of the one rotten one. Fortunately, Sensei, that’s why we chose you to tend to that apple cart- to advise the Make-Up Work Club…My apologies. I realize I’ve put you in the middle of quite the predicament. You have every right to resent me.
[Sensei]: “You wouldn’t have told me any of this if you were only planning to use me.”
[Nagisa]: You are correct. It’s good that you’re quickon the uptake. Sensei. I would like for you to suss out the traitor hiding among the Make-Up Work Club.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: They are already deceiving you and Trinity as we speak. She is a terrorist, and terorrist dfo not swish for peace. They think that they can risk the safety of Kivotos for their own personal gain. Finding the traitor is for the sake of Kivotos’ peace and safety. Surely that’s something you can sympathize with as a representative of Schale.
[Sensei]: “No, I’m going to find a solution MY way.”
[Nagisa]: Will you now? Though do remember the apple art. If you can’t spot the rotten one, we could always tip it over and dispose of all of them. There are many ways to alter exam results. For example, the contents, location, or difficulty of an exam could suddenly be changed at the last minute. Of course, it would be a shame if such a thing happened, but then again…Pardon me, Sensei. I’ll continue to leave the Make-Up Work Club under your care. I’d love to say that you personally won’t be exposed to any unpleasantries because of this…
[Sensei]: “I somehow doubt that.”
[Nagisa]: Right. I make no promises. But knowing you-someone who couldn’t bear to leave a student behind-I can hardly predict how things will ultimately turn out. I only hope that the end of this story will be a happy one. Oh, but there is one thing I want to make clear. We didn’t interfere with the first exam in any way. I promise you that.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Nagisa]: If you insist on doing things your way, then I hope it will be something that benefits Trinity. Well, then. Until next time.
[Nagisa]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Nagisa]: Episode 10- Boot Camp, Here We Come!
[Nagisa]: We start inside of a dorm room populated by some beds.
[Hanako]: We’re finally here! So, this is where our book camp is going to be?
[Hifumi]: H-Haha…Guess so.
[Hanako]: When I heard we’d be going to an unused annex, I just assumed it wouldn't be furnished at all. So much for sleeping naked together on the cold, hard floor. But it’s actually quite comfy-looking and spacious. Even the beds are really cute! I’m so glad we don't have to be on the floor when we sleep naked together! ♥
[Koharu]: Why does every scenario end with us sleeping together in the nude?! And there are plenty of beds, so stay in your own!
[Hanak]: Aw, are you sure? It’s not every day we get to attend boot camp together. We’re here to study, so…why not study a few other things about ourselves?
[Koharu]: We’re not here to study perversion! New lewdness allowed!
[Hanako]: A shame. Well, the day is still young. Let’s see if you change your tune later tonight. ♥
[Koharu]: …?!
[Hifumi]: Well, anyway. This is where we’re going to be staying over the next week. We’ll do everything from eat, to sleep, to study here. And that’s why I want you all to…Wait a sec. Where did Azusa go?
[Hanako]: Oh yeah. She was with us just a minute ago.
[Azusa]: Encampment scouting complete.
[Hifumi]: Scouting? Wait, did you just call the annex an encampment?
[Azusa]: We’re a comfortable distance from Trinity’s main building. Sniper fire is unexpected. Location acceptable. There are only two entrances connecting to the outside, which I also find favorable. Worst-case scenario, we could barricade one entrance and lead the enemy to an ambush in the first floor gym. I’ve also identified several weak points in our defenses, but they shouldn’t pose a problem with a little fortification.
[Hifumi]: U-uhhh…
[Azusa]: And this must be the barracks…Excuse me. Dormitory is the proper name, yes? Unexpectedly luxurious. I’m surprised such a valuable foothold has been lying unused. What a waste.
[Hifumi]: Azusa! We came here to study, not to prepare for a war, remember?
[Azusa]: I’m aware. We’re here to train for a week, correct? High-intensity training where we’re banned from leaving the grounds, having free time, and are under 24-hour surveillance a day.
[Hifumi]: It isn’t quite that strict…
[Azusa]: I’m prepared for anything. I brought all of my personal belongings, change of clothes, gtm equipment, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, dry goods, blankets, water…
[Hanako]: Oh, my. You’re so thorough, Azusa.
[Hanako]: Naturall. Preparedness is the key to survival.
[Hanako]: Heeheehee. Eating together, sleepingtogether, studying toward the same goal…Doesn’t boot camp sound absolutely divine?
[Azusa]: Um. Yes. I’m looking forward to it. But completing the mission comes first. I’ll study and pass the second evaluation exam. This is our main objective. It’s not my intention to be a liability again.
[Hifumi]: Azusa…
[Azusa]: By the way, I prepared anti-personnel mines and claymores for possible ambushes. I also brought the necessary materials to manufacture IEDs and antitank mines,
[Hifumi]: E-Enough, Azusa! We’re not going to need all that!
[Hifumi]: The screen fades in and out indicating a time lapse.
[Hifumi]: Hmm…Nagisa did say we’d have to go to boot camp if we failed the first evaluation exam. We’ll be here for a week until the second exam. The building is showing its age and is a little neglected, but it should be more than fine with some cleaning. And we will have a lot of amenities available to us, like a gym and shower room.
[Azusa]: There’s even a swimming pool outside. It looks like it hasn’t been used for a long time, though.
[Hifumi]: Yeah, and we’re within walking distance of the main building. There’s a kitchen in the basement where you can cook simple dishes too, so we shouldn’t go hungry. Not to mention, [NAME] Sensei will be with us the entire time we’re here, so we can always ask for help if we really need it…
[Sensei]: “Helping is my middle name.”
[Hifumi]: Haha. Thanks, Sensei. There’s a room for you at the other end of the hall to stay in too.
[Hifumi]: Hanako is slowly seen approaching Hifumi
[Koharu]: Stop right there, Hanako! No lewdness allowed!
[Hanako]: I didn’t say anything at all. I haven’ the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.
[Koharu]: That’s because it’s written all over your face! Do you want the death penalty?!
[Hanako]: My, you’re so strict.
[Azusa]: Is Sensei using the room down the hall truly necessary? There are enough beds in this room. I find splitting our unit apart to be to our disadvantage.
[Sensei]: “I’ll leave you all to get comfortable, so holler if you need me.”
[Hifumi]: S-Sure…well, let’s unpack and get to today’s studies.
[Hanako]: Wait a minute. Don’t you think there’s something else we should do first?
[Hifumi]: Huh?
[Azusa]: Practice installing traps while under fire?
[Hanako]: No…I mean cleaning.♥
[Hifumi]: C-Cleaning?
[Hanako]: Yes! The exterior’s been maintained, but the inside is so dusty and dirty from not having been used in so long, don't you think? How can that be good for us? They say a healthy body leads to a healthy mind, so let’s start off by giving this place a good cleaning before we hit the books!
[Hifumi]: I…guess you have a point. It makes sense to clean all the desks at the very least before we begin using them.
[Azusa]: Hygiene is a critical responsibility. It has a large effect on unit morale.
[Koharu]: Seriously? Cleaning? Well, I guess if it’s just a little bit…
[Hifumi]: I think Hanako makes a good point. We shouldn’t push ourselves too hard too soon. Let’s remember that this is a marathon, no a sprint. We have a long week ahead of us. All right, team! Let’s get ourselves fired up with some spring cleaning!
[Sensei]: “Let’s goooooo!”
[Hifumi]: Everyone, go change so you don’t get your uniforms dirty. We’ll gather downstairs in ten minutes!
[Azusa]: Understood.
[Hanako]: Okie doke!
[Koharu]: Clothes to wear for cleaning? I guess my gym clothes would work.
[The screen fades to black and the textbox states]: 
[The screen fades to black and the textbox states]: Ten Minutes later.
[The screen fades to black and the textbox states]: Hifumi is talking outside with Sensei in a field. She is wearing her gym clothes.
[Hifumi]: Sorry to keep you waiting, Sensei!
[Sensei]: 
[Sensei]: “You went with your gym clothes, huh?”
[Sensei]: “You look ready to get to work.”
[Sensei]: No difference in choices
[Hifumi]: Well, I needed to put on something appropriate for the occasion. My gym clothes are plenty easy to move around in and wash if they get dirty.
[Koharu]: So now what…?
[Hifumi]: You go here quickly, Koharu.
[Azusa]: Reporting in.
[Hifumi]: Uh, Azusa, I don’t think you need to carry your weapon right now…
[Azusa]: I would rather have my firearm and not need it than need it and not have it. Wouldn’t you?
[Hifumi]: I guess you have a point…
[Hifumi]: Hanako then appears wearing her school swimsuit
[Hanako]: Goodness. Am I the last to arrive?
[Koharu]: NO! NOPE! ABSOLUTELY NOT!
[Hanako]: Oh?
[Koharu]: Why would you need to wear your swimsuit for spring cleaning?! It’s completely inappropriate!
[Hanako]: But it’s easy to move in, and I’m used to getting…dirty when I wear it.
[Koharu]: What are you talking about?! You’re supposed to wear a bathing suit in the swimming pool! Wh-What if someone sees?!
[Hanako]: What’s the big deal;? It’s just us here.
[Koharu]: No! Absolutely, 100-percent forbidden! You are forbidden from wearing a bathing suit from now on!
[Hanako]: Aw.
[Hifumi]: H-Haa…ha…
[Hifumi]: The screen fades to black.
[Hifumi]: Hanako then left to change into her gym clothes.
[Hifumi]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hifumi]: Episode 11- Spring Cleaning!
[Hifumi]: This episode is a continuation of the last one
[Hifumi]: Let’s start off by clearing the weeds growing around the building! Also don’t forget to hydrate. Heat stroke is no joke.
[Hanako]: Okie dokie!
[Koharu]: Picking weeds? That shouldn’t be too hard.
[Azusa]: Understood. It would be wise to remove the brush around our encampment and give the enemy nowhere to hide.
[Hifumi]: We’ll move on to cleaning inside once we're done with the grounds around the buildings. Let’s go, people!
[The Scene fades to black as the textbox reads]: 
[The Scene fades to black as the textbox reads]: We then picked all the weeds surrounding the annex and put away all the junk lying around.
[Location Tag]: Dorm Hallway
[Hifumi]: I think we should give this hallway a quick sweep before we pull the mops out. It’s one of the most traveled parts of the building, so naturally it’s going to get pretty dirty. We’ll have to work hard to keep it clean.
[Azusa]: Roger that.
[Hifumi]: Would you mind cleaning the showers, restroom, and laundry room once we’re done here too?
[Azusa]: Of course not. Can do.
[Azusa]: Once again the screen goes dark and a textbox appears.
[Azusa]: The dorm hallway was then swept and mopped clean. Followed closely by the other facilities the girls would eventually use.
[Location Tag]: Annex Lobby
[Koharu]: *cough**cough* There’s so much dust.
[Hifumi]: You’re right. There’s a lot of furniture here, so I’m not surprised it’s easy for dust to accumulate. We’ll have to do a lot of cleaning to keep it maintained.
[Koharu]: I know that much! I’m used to taking care of rooms like this for the Justice Task Force! Put on a mask, use the duster, and wipe the rest away with a mop! I know how to handle myself!
[Hifumi]: S-Sorry. Okay, I’ll leave it in your hands, Koharu.
[Hifumi]: The screen goes dark.
[Hifumi]: Koharu got to dusting every nook and cranny of the lobby.
[Hifumi]: We then return back to the bedroom that the Make-Up WOrk Club are using to sleep in. It is still midday.
[Hifumi]: This place…
[Hanako]: Don’t worry, Hifumi. I’ll take care of the bedroom. We’ll be spending a lot of time here, so it needs some extra tender love and care. The bedding should be dry this afternoon if we wash and hang it now. And we should replace the old mattresses with unused ones from other rooms. Ventilation is also of the utmost importance since we’re sleeping here.
[Hifumi]: Sounds like you know what you’re doing, so I’ll trust the bedroom to you, Hanako.
[Hanako]: Heeheehee. Of course. ♥
[Hanako]: Another fade out, but then it goes to a montage of the classroom, gym, cafeteria, and finally we are brought outside.
[Sensei]: I think that pretty much covers it.”
[Koharu]: Yep, we're done! Everything is squeaky clean and feels so much more refreshing.
[Azusa]: Yes I have to agree.
[Hifumi]: So do I. Thanks for all of your help, everyone!
[Hanak]: Hold on, Hifumi. It looks like we still missed a spot.
[Hifumi]: What? Where?
[Hanako]: The outdoor pool.
[Hifumi]: O-Oh. Yeah, now that you mention it…
[Hifumi]: The fade goes to a background of a dirty and empty pool.
[Hifumi]: This place…
[Azusa]: …is rather large. It hadn’t even crossed my mind that we should need it for our make-up work studies.
[Koharu]: That’s because we don’t! Why should we have to clean something we’re never going to use?!
[Hanako]: Are you sure? We may not have use for it, but seeing a pool properly filled with water is important regardless. Imagine it. Our camp grounds glittering from a full pool, girls running around and playing outside…Wouldn’t that imagine alone lift our spirits?
[Koharu]: Wh-What are you talking about?! What girls?! You’re not making any sense!
[Hifumi]: No, I sorta get it. Seeing it left dry and neglected like this doesn’t feel quite right…
[Azusa]: A pool this size wasn’t built to be left empty. At some point it was filled with water and people laughing, enjoying this place as well. But this end was inevitable. Vanitas vanitatum. That is the truth of the world.
[Hifumi]: Uh…huh…
[Hanako]: Vanitas vanitatum. It’s an expression that means the vanity of vanities-all is vain, in other words. There was an ancient, wise saying like that…Listen up, Azusa! You too, Hifumi and Koharu!  We’re going to swim and play in the water together!
[Hifumi]: S-Swim?! And in what water?!
[Hanako]: Obviously, we’re going to clean the pool, fill it up, and jump in! We can start studying tomorrow, can’t we? We’ve worked hard enough today, so let’s take some time to relax. We’re sure to burn out studying if we just keep pushing ourselves! Come on, ladies! It’s time to start the pool cleaning. So go get changed and prepare to get wet!
[Azusa]: Yes. Even if everything is in vain, there’s no reason we shouldn’t give life our all.I also remembered to pack my swimsuit just in case. I’ll return shortly.
[Hifumi]: Azusa! She’s already gone…That’s just great.
[Hanako]: Well, don’t just stand there! You took, Koharu. Go after her and get changed. It can be your swimsuits or anything. Like I said, as long as you’re ready to get wet.
[Sensei]: “I really don’t like the way you keep saying that…”
[Hifumi]: Well, okay. But only because it wouldn’t feel right to leave this as the one place we didn’t get cleaned.
[Koharu]: Are we really doing this?! It doesn’t have anything to do with our make-up work classes. Ugh.
[Hanako]: Don’t be like that, Koharu. ♥
[Hanako]: Hanako slowly approaches Koharu as Koharu begins to panic.
[Koharu]: A-All right already! Just keep out of my personal space!!!
[Koharu]: The scene fades to black and back again. Hifumi and the rest of the club return in their school swimsuits.
[Hifumi]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Azusa]: …
[Azusa]: Hanako appears on the screen dressed in her normal school uniform.
[Hanako]: I love it! You all did exactly as I asked.♥
[Azusa]: Yes. I’m prepared for water activities.
[Hifumi]: All we did was put on our school swimsuits. It’s pretty standard for cleaning a pool after all…
[Hanako]: Great! Are we ready to get down and dirty?♥
[Koharu]: Hold on just a minute!
[Hanako]: What’s wrong, Koharu?
[Koharu]: Why are you the only one still in the school uniform?! You told us to go get changed into something we wouldn’t mind getting wet in!
[Hanako]: Yes. I fail to see the contradiction.
[Koharu]: What are you talking about?! You’re still in your uniform! Why is this the ONE time you choose not to put on that stup[id swimsuit you always wear?!
[Hanako]: Hmm. That’s difficult to answer. Some people like different things. I suppose you could say this is my…preference.
[Koharu]: Preference…?
[Hanako]: What do you think feels better to get wet in? A swimsuit or a schoolgirl uniform?
[Koharu]: What do you mean “feels better”?! And for who?!
[Hanako]: I’m only teasing you. And I am wearing a swimsuit underneath my uniform. It’s a bikini I bought with some spare pocket change.
[Koharu]: Huh? You are…?
[Hanako]: Don’t you remember? You forbade me from wearing my school swimsuit earlier, but I figured this personal one would be a loophole. And besides, my school-issued one is already in the laundry, so this is all I have. Think you can let it slide?
[Koharu]: Wh-Why are you asking me? Do whatever you want…
[Koharu]: HanakoL Heehee. Now, then. Is everyone ready?  Let’s get to cleaning!
[Koharu]: A CG of the Make-Up Work Club cleaning the pool takes up the screen.
[Hanako]: Look! I can make a rainbow with the hose!
[Hifumi]: Wh-Whoa! Hey, that’s cold!
[Hanako]: That’s because this water comes straight from the lake next to Trinity. It should even be clean enough to drink from!
[Koharu]: Why did we have to do this again…?
[Azusa]: This section is nearly finished. Advancing soon.
[Azusa]: The scene fades to black
[Azusa]: Everyone finished cleaning the pool and soon began to fill it with water. It took longer than expected, and the sun had already set by the time it was finished.
[Azusa]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Azusa]: Episode 12- First Night of Boot Camp
[Azusa]: It is nighttime at the newly cleaned pool as the water shimmers under the lights. Azusa is the first to appear in her normal school uniform, as does everyone else.
[Azusa]: ...
[Hifumi]: We didn't even get time to play in the pool after all that.
[Hanako]: I’m sorry. I didn’t account for the time to fill with water.
[Azusa]: No need to apologize. It was still an enjoyable mission .
[Koharu]: It’s surprisingly pretty at night.
[Hifumi]: It really is. I’ve never seen a school pool after dark before.
[Koharu]: *nod…*nod*
[Hanako]: Are you still with us, Koharu? You look like you’re about to fall asleep on your feet.
[Koharu]: N-No, I’m just…tired. Exhausted from today.
[Hifumi]: Well, we have been cleaning since morning. Should we all go inside now? We can start our camp studies tomorrow. It’s going to be hard to concentrate if we don’t get a good night’s rest.
[Azusa]: Fine…
[Hanako]: Let’s go back in, shall we?
[Hanako]: The scene transitions to the club’s bedroom, the students wearing their gym clothes again.
[Hifumi]: Phew, it’s good to be back inside.
[Azusa]: It was a successful day.
[Hanako]: Nice work out there, ladies. Let’s get some rest.
[Koharu]: Good night…
[Sensei]: “I’ll be down the hall. Let me know if you need anything.”
[Hanako]: But of course. I’ll be sure to remember that.
[Koharu]: Gah. The Justice Task Force would never abide by your indecency…
[Hifumi]: Why don’t we all get some sleep? I’m sure everyone must be tired. Good night, Sensei.
[Hifumi]: The screen goes black.
[Hifumi]: Return to your room.
[Hifumi]: The scene transitions to the dorm room that Sensei is using.
[Sensei]: 
[1]: “...”
[2]: “What a day.”
[2]: No difference in choices.
[2]: Nagisa appears in a flashback on a dark background
[Nagisa]: After all, the Make-Up Work Club’s true purpose…is to expel students.
[Sensei]: “(Just what is Nagisa planning?)”
[Sensei]: A knocking sound is heard.
[Sensei]: Someone is at the door.
[Sensei]: 
[1]: “Who is it?”
[2]: “Is someone there?”
[2]: No differences in choice.
[???]: Are you there, Sensei?
[???]: Open the door.
[Hifumi]: Sorry for bothering you so late.
[Sensei]: “I thought it was you, Hifumi.”
[Hifumi]: Yeah. I just can’t seem to fall asleep. There’s been a lot on my mind…
[Hifumi]: The screen goes black.
[Hifumi]: I chatted with Hifumi for a while.
[Hifumi]: Once again we return to the Dorm Room.
[Hifumi]: Thanks for helping us today, Sensei.
[Sensei]: “You girls did a great job.”
[Hifumi]: We’re supposed to formally start our boot camp first thing in the morning, but are we really going to be able to do this? There’s only a week until the second exam. Then there will be a third exam shortly after if we fail again. And if we fail that one…
[Sensei]: “Everyone will be expelled.”
[Hifumi]: Yeah. So you know. I haven’t told the others, and I’m not even sure if it’s really true, but…ugh. These are standard individual exams, but they’re using this strange collective punishment system. Even the fact we’re being forced to go through a boot camp of all things is odd. And on top of that…*sigh*
[Sensei]: “What did Nagisa tell you?”
[Hifumi]: Wh-What?! You…really want to know? Well…Yes, I spoke with her. She told me to keep this a secret, but it’s hard for me to keep it all to myself. There’s something going on. It’s…
[Sensei]: “Is it about finding Trinity’s traitor?”
[Hifumi]: You know about that too?! Well, about that…When i spoke to her, Nagisa said…
[Hifumi]: We transition to Trinity Terrace at night. Nagisa is speaking to Hifumi.
[Nagisa]: Hifumi, please find the traitor.
[Hifumi]: I’m sorry? What?! Th-That’s…
[Nagisa]: The results of the exams don’t matter. Expulsion after the third exam is a last resort, so to speak. Your mission is to collect as much information about the suspects as you can and find the traitor as quickly as possible. This is why you were placed in the Make-Up Work Club.
[Hifumi]: But why me? How did this happen…?
[Nagisa]: Why were you selected? Because of your existing relationship with Schale. The traitor won’t be able to do as they wish with Sensei present. Sensei is my insurance, my trash bin lid-seeing to it that the trash inside your club won’t escape so easily.
[Hifumi]: Did you just call us a trash bin?
[Nagisa]: Pay it no mind. Moving on…
[Hifumi]: W-Wait, Nagisa! I can’t do something like this!
[Nagisa]: Hifumi. There’s no other option. Don ‘t forget that you’re a failing student as well. I’m sure you understand what will happen to you if you were to fail this mission, yes?
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: “(Just like I thought. She’s taking advantage of hifumi too.)”
[Hifumi]: You have to be kidding me. Is there really a traitor? The thought alone is terrifying…We’re all supposed to be students of the same school. We spent all day cleaning together. We ate dinner together. How am I supposed to suspect any of them? They’re my friends. It’s too much. I can’t do this…
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hifumi]: …
[Hifumi]: Sensei “You’re a kind person, Hifumi.”
[Hifumi]: What was that?
[Sensei]: “You don’t have to worry about suspecting your friends.”
[Hifumi]: Sensei?
[Sensei]: “Leave everything to me.”
[Hifumi]: …
[Sensei]: “I want you to focus on helping the way YOU want to.”
[Hifumi]: How I want to…Right! I’ll put some thought into what I can do to help! Thanks for hearing me out. I feel a lot better now.
[Hifumi]: The screen goes black
[Hifumi]: Meanwhile…
[Hifumi]: Hanako is seen in the darkened Annex lobby
[Hanako]: …
[Azusa]: Hanako? What are you doing here?
[Hanako]: You’re still up too, Azusa? And you’re in your uniform.
[Azusa]: I’ve slept enough already. I was thinking of doing a nighttime patrol.
[Hanako]: Here? And did you really get enough sleep? You seem exhausted.
[Azusa]: I have trouble sleeping in places I’m unaccustomed to.
[Hanako]: …
[Azusa]: You don’t have to worry on my behalf. I’m trained to go five days without sleep if necessary.
[Hanako]: That’s not really the issue here.
[Azusa]: Anyway, I imagine everyone must be feeling anxious on our first night, hence why you and Hifumi went on walks. I wanted to go on patrol for your sakes. In fact, I should be getting back to that.
[Hanako]: Well okay. Don’t stay up too late Azusa.
[Hanako]: Azusa leaves
[Hanako]: ...
[Hanako]: Once more the screen goes dark.
[Hanako]: And so the first night of boot camp passed.
[Hanako]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hanako]: Episode 13- First Mock Exam
[Hanako]: The scene starts inside the bedroom the Make-Up Work Club is using.
[Azusa]: Good morning!
[Hanako]: Good morning, Azusa! You look chipper today.♥
[Azusa]: Of course. It’s important to start the day off well. Let’s not waste time. We have to brush our teeth, shower, and get changed into fresh uniforms.
[Hifumi]: Ugh, Azusa…just ten more minutes.
[Koharu]: Hnnngh…Morning already?
[Azusa]: Come on, Hifumi. Jokharu. It’s time to wake up.
[Hifumi]: Ugh…Fine.
[Koharu]: I’m up already…
[Hanako]: I think our little Hifumni had a long night last night. It might taker her a while to get out of bewd.
[Azusa]: It could be mental fatigue related to her responsibilities as our club president. Should we allow her to rest for longer than usual?
[Koharu]: W-Wait. Where am I? How did I get here?
[Azusa]: Good morning, Koharu. We’re on breakfast duty today, so we need to hurry.
[Koharu]: Wait, what?
[Azusa]: The showers are this way. I’ll help you wash, so follow me.
[Koharu]: H-Hold on a second. Why…?
[Hanako]: Aw. It looks like they’re going to be bath time buddies after all.
[Koharu]: Wh-Whaaat?! W-Wait. I can do that myself! You don’t have to undress me! Th-That’s cold! Aaaah! You’re getting shampoo in my eyes!
[Hanako]: Ah, sweet skinship.♥
[Location Tag]: Annex Classroom
[Hifumi]: Sorry for the wait. Is everyone ready to get started?
[Hanako]: I am!♥
[Azusa]: Hmm.
[Koharu]: *sniffle* She saw everything…I’ve been exposed…
[Azusa]: I was also without clothes. It’s standard procedure. What’s the problem?
[Koharu]: That’s not the point! You’re incorrigible! Don’t you understand how to be gentle with someone…?
[Hanako]: Would you like me to wash you next time, Koharu?
[Koharu]: That’s even worse! Anyone but you!
[Hifumi]: Guys, settle down…
[Sensei]: “You still have a little bed head, Hifunmi.”
[Hifumi]: P-Please don’t remind me of how badly i overslept. Never mind that! That’s not what’s important! I need your attention!
[Everyone]: …
[Hifumi]: Make-Up Work Club boot camp officially begins today. We have  a very long road ahead of us, and it will be easy to get discouraged…but think about it! We know what we must do! The only solution is for each of us to pass next week’s exam.
[Azusa]: Hmm.
[Hanako]: Right.
[Koharu]: O-Okay.
[Hifumi]: …That’s why we’re going to take a mock exam starting right now!
[Azusa]: Mock exam?
[Hanako]: Well, this is sudden.
[Koharu]: I’ll say! Why should we have to do that?!
[Hifumi]: Because our futures are on the line. We need to know where we all stand before we begin studying for the second exam! So to that end, I spent last night preparing this. I made my own exam based on the questions and answer key from last year’s exams! Sensei was able to get these for us and helped me last night. It should give each of us an idea how we’d score on the real exam if we were to take it right now. We’ll each have one hour. Max score is 1000 points with the minimum passing grade being a 60. It’s the same as a real exam. And i’m going to take it with all of you, of course.
[Hifumi]: First Make-Up Work Club Mock Exam
[Sensei]: “Everyone ready? You can leave the room once you’re done. Begin!”
[Sensei]: The screen goes white and transitions to a CG of the four students doing their test.
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: Oh, this one takes me back. ♥
[Koharu]: Gah…I know I’ve seen this before.
[Hifumi]: (That’s it, everyone! You can do this!)
[Hifumi]: I graded everyone’s tests once the exam was over.
[Hifumi]: All right, Sensei, we’re ready. Let us know our scores.
[First Make-Up Work Club Mock Exam Results]: 
[Hanako]: 4 Points (Fail)
[Azusa]: 33 Points (Fail)
[Koharu]: 15 Points (Fail)
[Hifumi]: 68 Points( Pass)
[Azusa]: Hmmm.
[Koharu]: …
[Hanako]: Well, then.
[Hifumi]: …I was afraid of this. It’s not looking good if we don’t turn things around. We’re going to have to study nonstop if we have any hope of us each scoring 60 points next week! Koharu and Azusa have to take the first-year exam, so I'm pairing the two of you together. It will be up to me and hanako to assist you. Didn't you have high grades your first year, Hanako?
[Hanako]: Well I did, but…
[Hifumi]: Don’t worry. Sensei and I will track your scores and figure out why you’ve been struggling. We can do this together! I want us to take mock exams like this from time to time moving forward…I’m not going to allow us to fail. We’re going to pass. We have our goal, so let’s keep working hard to achieve it!
[Sensei]: “(Way to go, Hifumi!)”
[Hifumi]: (There’s no time to sit around feeling sorry for myself. I have to do this! This is how I can help!)
[Azusa]: Very well. I’ll follow your lead.
[Koharu]: I-If I have to.
[Hanako]: I’m amazed at how you prepared this for us in so little time.
[Hifumi]: Thanks, but I couldn’t have done it without Sensei.
[Hanako]: Ah, I should have known this was your touch.
[Sensei]: “I didn’t do that much.”
[Hifumi]: Oh, and it’s not like I only prepared hard work for all of us. I also have prizes ready to award good grades on pop quizzes. Let’s see here…
[Hifumi]: *rustle**rustle*
[Hifumi]: An image of Momofriends dolls appears on the screen.
[Hifumi]: Ta-da! Whoever gets the highest score will be awarded with some Momo Friends merch!
[Hanako]: Momo…Friends?
[Koharu]: Plushes?
[Azusa]: …!
[Hifumi]: Yeah, they’re really popular lately. Surely you all have seen them.
[Hanako]: Nope. I think it’s my first time.
[Hifumi]: What?!
[Koharu]: What is this one supposed to be? A pig? A hippo?
[Hifumi]: N-No! Peroro is a bird! Look, here are his wings! And his beak!
[Koharu]: His eyes are annoying-looking. His name is weird too.
[Hifumi]: What?! I mean, sure, not everyone has to like Peroro, but look at all of his cute qualities…
[Hanako]: Oh, now I remember. You have this Peroro on your bag and phone case, don’t you? It’s the one that has its tongue hanging out, drooling like it’s begging for something, right?
[Hifumi]: What?! Peroro has never done anything like that!
[Koharu]: All the more reason to be prohibited.
[Hifumi]: Come on. Don’t be like that…
[Azusa]: (Stay calm…)
[Hifumi]: Azusa:?
[Azusa]: Cu…
[Hifumi]: “Cu”?
[Azusa]: So cute!
[Hifumi]: …?!
[Koharu]: …?!
[Hanako]: Well, then!
[Azusa]: I’ve never seen anything so cute! What is this round and fluffy-looking creature? A bird, you said? His eyes…I can’t read his expression at all! I can’t tell what he’s thinking, if anything!
[Hanako]: Azusa…? You’re starting to scare me.
[Hifumi]: There’s nothing to be afraid of! She understands Peroro’s cuteness! That’s something worth celebrating.
[Koharu]: What?!
[Azusa]: And what is this long one called? Is it a salamander…? No, a giraffe perhaps. It looks like I could wear it as a scarf?
[Hifumi]: That’s wavecat. He’s always doing a wave dance. And he did happen to get a neck pillow version recently.
[Azusa]: And this? This tiny one?
[Hifumi]: That’s Mr. Nicolai! He alway gets bullied for saying philosophical things! I also have a copy of Nocilair’s Beyond Good & Evil, the first edition! Let me know if you’d like to read it later.
[Azusa]: That sounds amazing! And you’re giving these away! I can pick?
[Hifumi]: Uh…yeah! You’ll be able to pick whichever one you want!
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: …
[Azusa]: *sigh* You leave me with no choice. With incentives lille these, my only option is to score high marks. Congratulations, Hifumi. You’ve successfully motivated your soldier. I’ll complete this mission at any cost, and those strange fluffy-looking things will be turned over to my custody.
[Hifumi]: I’ll be rooting for you. Good luck! Heehee.
[Hanako]: I can’t tell who’s having more fun right now: Azusa or Hifumi.♥
[Sensei]: “Hifumi looks like she made a new best friend. It’s sweet.”
[Koharu]: It’s creepy…
[Koharu]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Koharu]: Episode 14- Justice Task Force Vice President Part 1
[Koharu]: It is nighttime in the annex classroom.
[Koharu]: The girls continued to study until evening.
[Azusa]: Question, Koharu.
[Koharu]: Wha…? Why me?
[Azusa]: Because we’re studying the same material. I have a question about this problem.
[Koharu]: O-Okay. Wait. I do know this one! For this…you need to draw an auxiliary line from the bottom at a right angle. Like this! Okay, so this triangle and this triangle are proportional to each other, right? Look here, see?
[Azusa]: Oh. Now I get it. Thank you for the help. I’d expect nothing less of one of the Justice Task Force’s elite.
[Koharu]: …?! R-Right! I’m glad you agree. Feel free to ask for my help anytime you come across something you don't know. I’d be happy to help you.
[Azusa]: Sure. I owe you.
[Hanako]: Well, well. They’re getting along nicely, aren’t they? It must be because they grew so close once they established a skinship.♥
[Koharu]: Wh-What did you just say?! That has nothing to do with it!
[Azusa]: I didn’t mean to seem biased. I can help you wash as well, Hanako.
[Hifumi]: U-Um…
[Azusa]: Oh. There was another question I wanted to ask you, Koharu.
[Koharu]: Is it this one? This problem is a little…
[Azusa]: Do you not know the solution either?
[Koharu]: H-Huh?! No! But I’m sure I saw this in the reference book. Wait here. *rummages* Where did it go? I know it’s in here somewhere…Here!
[Koharu]: A book is shown. A woman and a man are in silhouette with a large disclaimer in the corner proclaiming R18 ADULT ONLY.
[Azusa]: This textbook has the answer?
[Koharu]: Yeah, this is the one! Huh?
[Hanako]: That’s some tasty-looking smut you’re hauling around.
[Koharu]: Aaahhh! Wh-Why is that here?!
[Hanako]: I didn’t know you read this kind of stuff. No use hiding it, little missy. It says “Adult Only” right there on the cover.
[Koharu]: Th-This isn’t what it looks like! It’s not mine! It’s not mine!!!
[Hanako]: Who do you think you’re fooling? I know erotica when I see it-especially the kind that’s a little…harder than usual. This is the good stuff. The kind you can’t find at Trinity-rare throughout all of Kivotos! The kind of steamy, raunchy, titillating goodness that leaves you screaming and throwing your rationality right out the window! Why do you of all people have something like this in your possession? Surely it’s against school rules, yes?
[Koharu]: N-No…I mean yes! I told you it’s d-definitely not mine…
[Hanako]: But it was in your bag, wasn’t it? And you brought it alllllll the way to boot camp. Seems like you couldn’t leave home without it. WHo would have guessed that the stubborn and prudish Koharu could be so naughty? Actually, now that I think about it, I don’t blame you. We are going to be at boot camp for quite a while. ♥
[Koharu]: IT’S NOT LIKE THAT!!!
[Azusa]: …?
[Hifumi]: Hanako…I think you’ve teased her enough.
[Hanako]: I may have gone a little too far. I was just so exited to have someone I could relate to.
[Koharu]: *sniffle**sniffle* …
[Hifumi]: So. Koharu…You’re saying you accidentally brought a book you confiscated while you were doing your Justice Task Force work, is that right?
[Koharu]: *sniffle* Yes. Managing confiscated goods is part of my duties.
[Hanako]: So that’s what happened. I have heard rumors that the basement of the old library is filled with stacks of forbidden books. No doubt that some of it was confiscated by the Justice Task Force. Still, isn’t this a conundrum/ you could get in serious trouble for carrying this around now that you’re a member of the Make-Up Work Club.
[Koharu]: *sniffle* It was an honest mistake. I forgot to turn it over…
[Hifumi]: Maybe you should return it before anyone notices it’s missing.
[Hanako]: Can’t you sneak back into the Justice Task Force headquarters?
[Koharu]: Now?
[Sensei]: “I’ll go with you.”
[Koharu]: Are you serious, Sensei?
[Hanako]: That sounds like a wonderful idea. You’re a lot less likely to get on Hasumi’s bad side if Sensei’s with you. Hey, Koharu. Try not to “accidently” sneak away the sequel on your way back.
[Koharu]: I WON’T!
[Koharu]: The screen goes dark.
[Koharu]: Koharu and I then left for the Justice Task Force club room.
[Koharu]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Koharu]: Episode 15- Justice Task Force Vice President Part 2
[Koharu]: The episode starts with koharu and Sensei out on Trinity campus.
[Koharu]: … J-Just to clarify, this really was all one big misunderstanding!
[Sensei]: “Huh? What was?”
[Koharu]: Th-That…book. I’m usually better about hiding it. I-I mean, I don’t carry it with me.
[Sensei]: “Don’t get caught next time.”
[Koharu]: …?! What are you trying to say?! That breaking the rules is fine as long as you don’t get caught?! You’re supposed to be an adult! A sensei! Indecency is forbidden! You’re going to be sentenced to death! Death!!!
[Sensei]: “Wouldn’t you get the same sentence?”
[Koharu]: …?! I-I…I made an honest mistake! It doesn’t count!
[Sensei]: “If you say so.”
[Koharu]: I do say so! Are you mocking me?!
[Sensei]: “You shouldn’t be ashamed to be yourself.”
[Koharu]: H-Huh?
[Sensei]: “You should be more comfortable with who you are.”
[Koharu]: …I-I don’t know what you’re talking about. But…I know you’re trying to look out for me….Hmph!  Okay! I’ll share an important secret with you in return!
[Sensei]: “Secret?”
[Koharu]: …The truth is…I’m a spy who was sent here to monitor the Make-Up Work Club’s progress.
[Sensei]: “...?”
[Koharu]: Simply put,. I’m carrying out a secret mission. I’m putting on an act adn am not really such an idiot!
[Sensei]: “Who sent you?”
[Koharu]: Wh-Who sent me…? Oh right. It’s, um…Hasumi! That’s right! Hasumi is the powerful vice president of Trinity’s Justice Task Force! A-And right above her is…President Tsurugi! She’s backing it!
[Sensei]: “You don’t say.”
[Koharu]: I-It’s because President Tsurugi is so brilliant! It’s like she can see 1,000 moves ahead. She’s a master of the pen and sword! Or, so I’ve heard. I haven’t been allowed to see her that many times…but I know it’s true. Now do you get it? I didn’t end up in the Make-Up Work Club because I’m actually bad at studying! I’m actually an amazing spy who is carrying out an Important undercover mission!
[Sensei]: “Whatever you say.”
[Koharu]: …
[Sensei]: “Are you sure it’s okay to blow your cover to me?”
[Koharu]: …?! Y-You wouldn’t expose my secret, would you, Sensei? I told you because I know I can trust you!
[Location Tag]: Contraband Room
[Koharu]: *sigh* It’s done. I put it back where it’s supposed to be. Thank goodness it’s over. Now we can-
[Koharu]: A door handle clicks and Hasumi enters.
[Hasumi]: Koharu?
[Koharu]: H-Hasumi?!
[Hasumi]: And Sensei is with you too. Shouldn’t you both be at the annex for boot camp? You’re not permitted to return for the justice Task Force until your grades are above passing.
[Koharu]: I know that, but the thing is, um…
[Koharu]: Come up with a good excuse.
[Hasumi]: Oh, so you came to pick up a book to help with your studies. Of course. That’s a perfectly valid reason to visit.
[Koharu]: Y-Yeah.
[Hasumi]: It’s excellent timing actually. There’s something I’ve been needing to discuss with you.
[Koharu]: What? With m-me…?
[Hasumi]: My apologies, but could you give us a moment of privacy, Sensei? This is an important matter that is for Justice Task Force member ears only.
[Sensei]: “Sure, okay”
[Hasumi]: Sorry, Sensei.
[Hasumi]: The screen goes black.
[Hasumi]: I decided to wait in the room next door.
[Hasumi]: The room is empty from Sensei’s perspective.
[Hasumi]: Please do this…Koharu. The objective is really…
[Sensei]: “...”
[Koharu]: But that’s…for that. It’s too…The mission…too difficult…
[Hasumi]: There’s no other choice! It must be done!
[Sensei]: “(That was hasumi shouting just now…)”
[Hasumi]: Can’t…but if it must continue for…And Sens…knows….
[Koharu]: Yes. I…try…
[Koharu]: Koharu returns back in the room.
[Koharu]: Sorry to keep you waiting, Sensei. Let’s head back now.
[Sensei]: “Is everything okay?”
[Hoharu]: Hmm? Yeah, nothing to worry about.
[Hoharu]: The scene once again goes black.
[Hoharu]: Koharu and I made our way back. The second day of boot camp came to a quiet ending.
[Hoharu]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Hoharu]: Episode 16- Crack in the Surface
[Hoharu]: We start in the Make-Up Work Club bedroom
[Hifumi]: Ahhh! I feel so much better now!
[Azusa]: Showered already? It’s still early.
[Hanako]: Are you forgetting? Hifumi slept in so long this morning that she didn’t get the chance to take a shower.
[Hifumi]: H-Hey! You don’t have to say it out loud…it’s embarrassing.
[Azusa]: You only slept in because you were up late last night preparing our mock exam. You aren’t the one who should be ashamed. If anything, I regret letting you down after all of your effort. Let me know if you would like to sleep in tomorrow as well. I’d be more than happy to help you wash up in the morning to save time.
[Hifumi]: Wh-What? That’s okay, I think I’ll manage!
[Koharu]: She can wash herself! She’s not a child!
[Azusa]: I know-I’m simply trying to be efficient. There are several advantages to bathing together, such as water conservation.
[Hanako]: She has a good point, but it’s not like we have a luxurious bathouse where we can all spread out and get to know each other better. Oh, I know. What if instead we all went skinny dipping in the pool next time? It’ll be just as good as a bathhouse!
[Koharu]: That doesn’t make sense at all! Prohibited! Completely prohibited!
[Azusa]: I don’t particularly mind, but what advantage would there be? Swimsuits are required for the school pool.
[Hanako]: Think about how liberating it would feel…and so much fun! Heehee!♥
[Azusa]: Enjoyment! I hadn’t considered that. And it would be…liberating, you said?
[Koharu]: Stop corrupting her! Stop, stop, stop, stop!!! You’re nothing but a degenerate and corrupter! Trinity already has enough perverts running around!
[Hanako]: Really? I had you pegged for the type that would totally be into skinny dipping. Was I wrong?
[Koharu]: What gave you that idea?! Pools require swimsuits! It’s justice, and anything else is deserving of the death penalty.
[Hanako]: Hmmm. In that case…
[Hanako]: Hanako slowly approaches Koharu.
[Hanako]: The bikini I was wearing at the pool yesterday…
[Koharu]: What are you whispering about?!
[Hanako]: Would that really count as a swimsuit?
[Koharu]: …?! I-If it wasn’t a swimsuit, then what was it?
[Hanako]: It’s funny how many different types of lingerie there are these days. Some of them can easily pass as swimsuits at first glance. ♥
[Koharu]: …?! Are you saying that’s what it was? Don’t tell me you…!
[Hanako]: Goodness. Why are you shaking so much? So what if it wasn’t a swimsuit? How would that change the experience we shared, Koharu?
[Koharu]: H-Huh?
[Hanako]: What’s the difference between a swimsuit and underwear to begin with? Waterproofing? Body protection? Design? The exposed areas? They’re no different from the outside looking in, right? And that’s why you believed me when I said it was a swimsuit, didn’t you?
[Koharu]: …?
[Hanako]: What if I turned around and said it really was just my bra and panties? How could that be proven either? What’s the point in being told a truth that you can’t trust or prove for yourself?
[Koharu]: S-Stop talking in circles! Which is it?!
[Hanako]: Heeheehee! It was a bathing suit. Sorry, it’s just so fun teasing you. I can’t help myself. ♥
[Koharu]: Y-You just wanted to tease me the whole time?!
[Azusa]: Now I understand. Hanako was alluding to the fifth koan.
[Hanako]: …?!
[Hifumi]: The fifth…what? What are you talking about?
[Hanako]: ...
[Azusa]: It’s something I’ve heard about in passing-Kivotos’ seven koans that date back to ancient times. I believe she was referring to the fifth one. “Can we prove anyone has ever reached paradise?” That’s how I remember it, but I can't say I know the rest. It’s a rhetorical question meant to ponder the existence of paradise if no one alive has ever seen it.
[Hanako]: I’m surprised you knew that.That would mean…Azusa! Have you met Seia before?
[Azusa]: ...
[Koharu]: Seia?
[Hifumi]: You mean Seia from the Tea Party, don’t you?
[Azusa]: ...No. As I said, it’s just something I've heard in passing.
[Hanako]: …That’s right, you were a transfer student. So if you didn’t hear it at Trinity…”Vanitas vanitatum…” And another academy…Forget i said anything. It’s already getting pretty late, so we should get some sleep. Good night, everyone!
[Location Tag]: Sensei’s Room
[Location Tag]: Later that night.
[Hifumi]: There’s something I wanted to talk to you about, Sensei. It’s about Hanako.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Hifumi]: It’s something I came across when looking at last year’s model answers when prepping the mock exam. Every answer came from only one student’s exams.
[Sense]: “Let me guess…”
[Hifumi]: Exactly. It was Hanako.
[Hifumi]: I’m not proud of it, but I took a peek at her first-year scores as well. They were perfect. She aced even advanced classes that third-year students struggle with. She’s a genius…But for some reason, Hanako’s grades ghave completely plummeted as a second-year.
[Sensei]: “Are you saying that she’s…?”
[Hifumi]: Yes. I think Hanako is intentionally scoring poorly on her exams. Why would she do such a thing?
[Location Tag]: Annex Lobby
[Azusa]: …
[Hanako]: …Is she on another one of her night patrols?...
[Hanako]: We come again to the Make-Up Work Club bedroom
[Hifumi]: *yawn*  Good morning.
[Hifumi]: Next we go to the annex classroom.
[Azusa]: *shuffle*
[Hanako]: …
[Koharu]: *sigh*
[Hifumi]: (I thought something felt strange…I haven’t seen Sensei all morning.)
[Location Tag]: Annex Pool
[Mika]: Wow! The pool is full! It’s been a long time since I’ve seen this old thing filled like this. Were you planning on going swimming? Maybe organizing a pool party?
[Sensei]: “What did you call me here for?”
[Mika]: Heeheehee. I was just wondering how you were doing.
[Mika]: <<To be Continued…>>
[Mika]: Episode 17- Trinity’s Traitor
[Mika]: Nagi is really going all-in, isn’t she? Even signing off on you all using these facilities for your make-up work classes. So, how goes it? I hope you aren’t simply pretending to keep busy so you can have pool parties with the students. You wouldn’t do something like that, would you?
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: …You don’t have to be so wary, Sesei. You’re going to hurt my feelings. Are you at least eating properly? I could always have your classes catered if you’d like. Would tea and cake be all right? My apologies. I understand. You’re not interested in small talk. In that case, I’ll get straight to the point. And for the record, Nagi doesn’t know I’m here right now. I’m by myself, as you can see…She offered you a deal, didn’t she?
[Sensei]: “A deal…?”
[Mika]: I’m referring to searching for Trinity’s traitor.
[Sensei]: “...”
[Mika]: I thought that might be it. She’s a card, that one. She didn't even give you all the details, I’m willing to bet. She just dumped the responsibility in your lap and told you to get to work. And she didn’t offer a proper reason or intent behind it either, did she? Did Nagi tell you why the Make-Up Work Club was founded this way? Really…She told you nothing at all and burdened you with so much.
[Sensei]: “I rejected her offer.”
[Mika]: You did Why? Is it because you didn’t want to suspect your own students, or…?
[Sensei]: “It’s not my role to find Trinity’s traitor.”
[Mika]: Oh? So that’s it. You represent Schale, meaning you’re ultimately an interloper in all of this-unbelonging to Trinity. It’s only natural that those of us whose world revolves around Trinity would have difficulty understanding your reasoning. How fascinating. It’s a fresh perspective if nothing else. Then whose side are you on, Sensei? If you’re not onTrinity’s side…then Gehenna? The General Student Council? Or maybe you’re on no one’s side…
[Sensei]: “I’m on the student’s side.”
[Mika]: …Aw…I wasn;t expecting you to say something like that…Well, if that’s the case…does that mean you’re on my side too? I know I may not seem like one sometimes, but I’m technically a student too, you know.
[Sensei]: “I’ll be by your side if you ever need me to be.”
[Mika]: …Wow…You sure know how to flatter a lady, Sensei. Are all adults this smooth? I guess there’s no hiding how happy that made me. Heehee. But doesn’t this also prove my point? I foy’ure on everyone’s side, that means you can never truly pick sides as well, does it not? So why don’t I cut you a deal of my own?
[Sensei]: “A deal…?”
[Mika]: I’ll tell you which member of the Make-Up Work Club is the traitor.
[Sensei]: “...!”
[Mika]: It’s the same traitor that Nagi has been searching for-the very person she’ll stop at nothing to expel. The truth is that the situation is much more complicated than it seems. It wouldn’t be courteous of me to simply watch you be swayed by Nagi. Did you know that inviting you to be the Make-Up Work Club’s homeroom teacher was my idea?
[Sensei]: “You, Mika?”
[Mika]: Yup. Nagi was opposed to the idea. She said she didn’t want to waste the favor you owed on something like this.
[Mika]: …
[Mika]: I wanted it to be someone who was from neither Trinity nor Gehenna.Oh, and as for the traitor…they are indeed one of your Make-Up Work Club students.
[Mika]: The screen goes dark and Azusa appears on the screen.
[Mika]: Shirasu Azusa.
[Mika]: We see Azusa doing one of her nightly patrols, first at the annex lobby and then in a ruined building.
[???]: You’re late.
[Azusa]: …
[???]: How are the preparations coming along?
[Azusa]: Smoothly. All according to plan thus far.
[Azusa]: We return back to mika and Sensei at the pool.
[Sensei]: “It’s Azusa?”
[Mika]: Correct. As you may know, she hasn’t always attended Trinity. She was originally a student from the Arius Satellite School, which broke away from the Trinity Union a long time ago. Well, “student” might not be fully accurate. Education was never truly a part of Azusa’s experience.
[Sensei]: “Why are you telling me this?”
[Mika]: …I’m sure you asked the same of Nagi at one point. Though, I can’t fathom how she responded. I won’t bore you with the excuses, so let me be blunt.
[Mika]: The scene goes back to Azusa and the mysterious person she is meeting in the ruins. Azusa turns into the focus of the screen as she is centered on a dark background.
[Mika]: : You must protect her.
