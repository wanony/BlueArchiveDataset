 Greetings! Kaiser Industries, the leading purveyor of top-tier firearms. How may I help you?
 Our VIP client!
 Greetings! What a pleasure to speak with you again!
 How can I help you today? We have some brand new missiles I think you would love.
 Or… Oh, dear! Were there any issues with the cluster bomb you purchased? I would be glad to assist you with that as well.
 Sell? Well, we don’t usually allow purchases from our sales line.
 But our VI{ clients have special privileges! What is it you were hoping to sell?
 That is quite the list of rare weaponry! You’re sure you’re willing to sell them?
 Well, such special equipment is always in demand. This is a little outside of protocol, but I suppose…
 Very well. I accept.
 Is the same account we have on file still correct for payment?
 …Weapons? Ammo?
 While I would love to assist you, we unfortunately just recently sold our entire stock of weapons.
 Yes. An…anonymous customer recently bought us out.
 I…cannot tell you that.
 As a VIP client, you must understand. You would rather be upset if we divulged your private purchase history, no?
 I’m terribly sorry, but let’s pretend this exchange never happened.
 I hope we have more fruitful dealings in the future!
 Hangs up
