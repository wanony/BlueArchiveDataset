 Y-Yeah, everything is taken care of. We’re still on schedule.
 Th-This is it, huh? There’s gonna be a lot of suffering, but it’s the only way.
 On standby in front of the passage. Green to enter the target area at the expected time.
 G-Got it! The head prefect!
 What about you, Saori?
 Th-That Hina girl is still standing…
 Wh-What do we do now? How are we supposed to contain someone strong enough to withstand that? If she’s still willing to fight, this is going to hurt… We’re gonna suffer…
 Towards Saori holding her phone
 Y-Yes! I-I’ll try!
 Fade back to Hiyori, with 2 Arius Students
 W-Well, we have our orders. Sorry about this… haha.
 W-We can’t exactly let you leave…
 O-Oh, boy. Here comes the suffering.
 Cut to Makoto
 Team III is currently engaging Hina! Team V is going underground as planned!
 *cough* *cough* S-Sorry. We couldn’t stop her. She knocked us down and slipped by us before the Council could manifest.
 Th-There she is! It’s Hina!
 Finally… I’m surprised she made it so far with those kinds of wounds.
 Heehee…
 A-An ambulance?
 Car Screeching
 H-How can she still have this much strength?
 Hime’s signing something… Everything would have gone according to plan without Sensei? And Azusa wouldn’t have betrayed us?
 H-Heehee. I guess It's been a while…
 Oof. That looked like it hurt.
 Th-That by itself wouldn’t mean much. Well, if not for the commandments that is.
 Fade to 3 Justina Members (Mimesified)
 I-I’ve confirmed Gehenna and the Tea Party’s reserve forces standing outside the cathedral have also begun to move!
 Both academies’ armored divisions will be here soon.
 Th-That’s what she gets for her treachery, huh?
 Wh-Wha…?! We’re gonna fight them here after all?
 Oh. Th-That’s gonna be tough--really tough…but I guess there’s no getting around that, huh? Heh…
 Justina Council Members
 Th-That must be it…
 Wh-What’s wrong?
 About three hours…?
 You mean Azusa?
 Shaking
 Ahhhhhh!
 There’s more of ‘em!
 BOOM!
 …!
 Ahhh! She set up timed ones too! We have to get outta here!
 Hiyori zooms away.
 I-I’m sorry. It hurts so much… Why must life always be suffering?
 Shuffling, as the background returns.
 S-Saori.
 Sh-She’s right. Hime is wounded, and the Council isn’t doing so hot…
 …
 Four reinforcements confirmed. No, wait--there are more coming.
 …?!
 Th-The Masked Swimsuit Gang! I thought they were just an urban legend, but they’re real…
 We’re surrounded…
 The Dark clouds. They’re…
 Is this… some kind of miracle?
 Th-They’re in peril. The commandments say to follow the ETO’s orders, but now there’s two of them.
 Saori…?
 It’s happening to the entire Council--even Ambrosius.
 I don’t think I can go on any longer…
 H-Hold on a little longer, Leader.
 Th-That’s not good. People die when they’re killed… And even if we’re not, the suffering isn’t gonna end…
 O-Oh, is it finally starting? It's going to be painful, right? It's definitely going to be painful.
 H-Hime is saying something in sign language. Um…
 R-Rain? But I don't like rain. It's wet and cold and irritating...and it gets everywhere.
 Fade to black
 I’m gonna c-cry…!
 Y-Y-You can’t be serious, Saori!
 Hime… I-I don’t like this….
 Hime… I-I don’t like this…
 Oh no…
 Arius students and Atsuko walk away
 …
 L-Leader…
 Thank goodness. H-How did you find me?
 …
 ………
 HUHHHH? WHAT?!
 Why are Leader and Sensei together?
 I-Is it time for my suffering and punishment? My miserable time on this planet is coming to an end!
 I see… You saved me so you could capture and torture me yourself!
 That’s why you arrived when you did! You’re gonna throw us into that underground prison! I was told that place is full of the screams of students who rebelled against Schale.
 Waaah! I’m finished. I’m totally finished. If I knew my life would end so early, I would have tried to enjoy it more! I would’ve finished all the magazines I wanted to!
 I’m not going to die? Why are you with Sensei then, Leader? What is happening? Oh…!
 Is Sensei threatening you, Leader? Oh no! Leader’s life is a long series of suffering, just like me! Look at the pain on her face! I’m so sorry for existing!
 …
 Huh?! Me? Did you get the wrong person?
 Did you get hit on the head? Do you not remember who you are? I might cry with relief if you’re actually rescuing me…but are you? I don’t know what’s happening…
 …??
 Hime… Atsuko…
 Do…Do you really think we can save Hime from Madame?
 Um…
 …
 She offered to let me go back to the Arius district if  I sold out Leader’s location.
 She said, seeing as I was just following orders, she would be lenient…
 …H-Huh?
 Wh-What?! But I…
 But… You see… I turned it down…
 …
 Wh-What is this change in mood? Why do you look like you’re relieved you could forgive a traitor! Am I a traitor to you?! Waaaah! This is the worst!
 I mean… What if she was lying? And…we’ve been doing this together this whole time… I don’t want to go back without you…
 And…what about Atsuko?
 I can’t just leave Atsuko behind and retreat to safety.
 You feel the same, don’t you, Leader? That’s why you came to get me.
 …Right. We need her… Let’s go!
 I…I think I know where she might be.
 O-Okay…!
 [An Abandoned Bridge]
 This place…
 M-Misaki…!
 A-Along the same lines, more or less.
 M-Misaki…?!
 *shiver*
 Phew… Everything worked out…
 Okay, th-then, this way!
 Seeing how the real entrance changes so much, we can’t find it without them telling us.
 B-But we’ve figured out one valid entrance. That’s our ticket in.
 We gotta hurry…
 Gunfire
 ?!
 Oh geez, life really is suffering.
 I-Is this the power of an adult?! I don’t know if I should be scared or amazed!
 Yes!
 <<To be Continued>>
 10 - To the Arius District 2
 Upon arriving at the entrance to Trinity’s underground catacombs, the Arius Squad members attempt to break through their enemies with brute force.
 A-Are we sure this is a good idea then?
 Heehee… I’m excited to work with Sensei.
 …?!
 Sensei was following close behind… No more than a few minutes.
 W-We’re gonna lose?!
 Sh-She’s already there!!!
 H-How is she so…strong…fast… Urgh!
 Hiyori falls
 Th-The passage is gonna close! H-Hurry!
 *pant* *pant* W-We’re alive…
 And there’s no signal either…so if you get lost you’ll be lost forever and ever and ever.
 …
 …All clear! Come up!
 N-Not a soul in sight.
 …
 …This was a training ground once.
 I…
 I remember this place. I met Azusa for the first time here.
 I think it was shooting training… Some kit was getting beat for disobeying orders.
 No one said anything…just watched in fear. But she kept standing back up, no matter what the teacher did!
 I remember crying because…b-because I thought her halo was gonna be destroyed.
 Then Saori…I mean Leader came running up…
 Waaaah! L-L-Leader?!
 This whole time? When could she have gotten sick?!
 C-Can we do anything to help her?
 S-Sensei’s pocket is magical! There was medicine in it!
 I knew it… Adults are so…scary…
 Leader is really suffering…
 D-Do you want me to keep watch?
 Y-You’re the best Misaki.
 Fade to black
 I sat in a corner and fell asleep quickly…
 …
 Fade to white
 S-Sensei?
 I-I’ve been keeping a close you on Leader’s condition. Her fever’s gone down, but she’s still resting…
 Huh? Th-That’s…
 …
 She also taught us that the source of our suffering was Trinity…that Gehenna would never deign to coexist with us.
 And she made us believe murderers like us would never be accepted at another school.
 She was our master. She told us she was a grown-up who taught the truth of the world. That we must follow and respect her.
 She was an adult. We didn’t know anything but to accept her teachings.
 Anyone who rebelled was punished ruthlessly, like Azusa and Hime.
 S-Sensei?! Why do you look so scary? Did we do something wrong?
 Y-Your story made Sensei mad, Misaki…
 Wh-Why we call her Hime?
 Well… Um… B-Because she’s Hime, I guess?
 I can remember Hime’s pretty dress… She look so graceful compared to us.. Heehee.
 Leader and I always admired her… Misaki didn’t seem to care either way though.
 R-Really? All this time?!
 …
 …
 I still have nightmares about it… Leader was almost as scary as the adults.
 …
 L-Leader?!
 I-I’m so relieved…! I might cry… I didn’t know what to do…!
 Go save Hime…?
 …
 F-Former institute? It’s in ruins! It’s been falling apart for decades now!
 B-But what other choice do we have? There’s too many students to try to bulldoze our way through.
 Oh geez, life really is suffering.
 Let’s go, Squad!
 Fade to black
 [Somewhere in the Arius District]
 Oh geez, life really is suffering.
 There’re a number of unfamiliar things about this street.
 Like, has this area always had all this crazy stuff?
 Cruise missiles installed everywhere, weapons for distribution everywhere you look.
 Come to think of it, don’t you think the Mimesises are really weird? We just accepted them without question.
 …
 Fade to black
 Th-The Council?! Is it the Saint Justina Council? Why’re they so scary looking?
 Hime did as the wooden doll in the cathedral told her to, just as she was instructed.
 Wh-What was that…?
 …
 …We’re surrounded?!
 Sh-She read us like a m-magazine!
 (Yes, yes, yes. W-We’re…ready!)
 S-Sensei?
 A-Are you sure she’s not gonna get up again?
 …
 Wh-Where did she go?
 Oh geez, life really is suffering.
 Hiyori leaves
 I’ve n-never been inside before…
 It’s so weird to think the original Arius students studied in there. I wonder what kind of lessons they had…
 Th-This way! I think this is it!
 S-S-Sensei! Oh no, turn around! That pillar’s collapsing!
 Black screen
 Th-Thank goodness. I know these ruins are old, but it collapsed outta nowhere.
 …
 W-Wait! Where’s Leader?
 I-I’ll move the pillar for you, Leader! Just wait one second!
 Hiyori fucking moves the pillar
 Augh! What do I do? Me moving it is just making everything worse! Why do I always make everything worse?
 Black screen with explosion
 Everything is ruined! Leader! Are you okay?
 …?!
 L-Leader…!
 ……
 S-So we shouldn’t leave…
 H-Hey…
 Who’s the girl in the middle over there? Sh-She’s wearing a really pretty dress…
 Really?! She’s royalty?
 Woah! A real princess! She lives a totally different life from people like us.
 I bet she’s never stolen food…or had frostbite…or slept on a cold floor…
 In a world full of suffering…I didn’t know such a beautiful person could exist… It’s so heartwarming. *sob*
 Sorry, b-but… *sob*
 Oh… Oh, no…
 Please… Please stop… *sob*
 Thank goodness you're okay, Leader... I mean...kind of okay. Well, at least you’re alive.
 The sun h-hasn't even risen yet...!
 H-How scary... It's stronger than anything we've ever encountered...even the artificial angels…
 This is...a holy place…
 W-We have to help... Hime…
 Black screen
 Oh... Oh, no…
 ...is just a monster…
 Yeah!
 Y-Yeah! We're gonna save Hime!
 Black screen
 Sh-She's summoning more of the scary ghosts?!
 This song…
 Sh-She's changing again?!
 L-Leader?!
 Yes! I'm ready!
 I-Is it...over?
 !
 Ack! Is Hime okay?!
 Get her down! P-Please! Right now!
 Black screen with running
 Oh no…
 H-Hime…
 …
 Fade to black
 H-Hime! Can you hear us?!
 I-Is it really over?
 …
 L-Leader?!
 L-Leader…
 …
 …
 A-And you're really good at teaching, even though you're kinda scary…
 L-Leader as a teacher?!
 …
 S-Sensei left so fast!
 Mika is kinda...scary... Will Sensei be okay?
 Leader…
 I-I've never gone this way before…
 What if it takes us somewhere horrible?
 ...That doesn't make it less scary.
 ?
 …Huh?
 Wh-Where's Leader?!
 Wasn't she behind us?! She disappeared! Maybe she was eaten…
 Left?! What do you mean l-Ieft? How could she leave? Where'd she go?
 But why? Leader…
 B-But...will she come back? I miss her already…
 So we have to keep going on our own? Without her?
 Oh no…
 …Sensei.
