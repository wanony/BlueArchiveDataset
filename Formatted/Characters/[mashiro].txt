 Mission accomplished! Shirasu Azusa has been successfully apprehended!
 Thank you for keeping watch, Koharu…wait…
 Tsurugi is at the top of her game today.
 And here I was feeling a little tired. I don’t have any excuses if the president is still so fired up.
 I’ll follow her example and work even harder!
 Technically, her paperwork to transfer back from the Make-Up Work Club hasn’t gone through yet. I’ll take care of this and go back to campus!
