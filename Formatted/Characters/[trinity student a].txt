 Ahhhhhh!
 What’s one of Gehenna’s Vehicles doing here?!
 Injured? Who cares about Gehenna’s wounded?!
 The Remedial Knights?
 The captain of the Remedial Knights…?
 Ahhhhh! My eyes! I can’t see!
 The Vigilante Crew… I heard they even clash with the Justice Task Force when they have to.
 How dare she attack Seia? Bring her out!
 Please! This isn’t the right time!
 Shaking
 Black screen with a loud sound
 Th-The wall! The wall collapsed!
 Back to a smoky scene
 M-M-M-Miso…! M-Mika…!
 Black screen
 Misono Mika has escaped!
