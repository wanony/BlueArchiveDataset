 The Schale club room? That’s over in the outskirts. Things are kind of crazy over there right now…
 A suspended student escaped from the Corrections Bureau and is wreaking havoc. It’s a battlefield over there right now!
 They rallied all the thugs in the area and are destroying everything in their path to get revenge on the General Student Council. I hear they’ve even got a Crusader Tank!
 They must be trying to occupy the Schale building because they know the General Student Council controls it. Maybe they think there’s something valuable inside.
 Oh, well. The city’s already a dump, so I don’t think it’ll make that much of a difference… Oh, great! The food I ordered is here. I’ll talk to you later!
