 Are you ready?
 And what of contact with that doll?
 Good. Then there shouldn’t be any complications.
 Cruise missile status?
 And teams II and III?
 Enter as soon as the cathedral collapses. Misaki and Team II will handle Trinity’s forces while Team III and Hiyori will face Gehenna’s.
 Team II is to keep its sights set on Tsurugi, and Team III must stay on top of Hina. Make sure not to lose them.
 As for Teams I and V…
 Yes. From there, you’ll follow  the passage to the basement. Your mission is the most important. Understood?
 I know. Please hold out for as long as you can, Hime.
 I have business elsewhere. I’ll be joining Team V once it’s taken care of.
 Break formation and advance.
 *Footsteps*
 *The scene shows the Justice Task Force, and the rest of the Prefect Team*
 *and to the cafe where the Make-Up Work Club is currently in*
 *A countdown has started ticking*
 *The scene returns to the cafe*
 No excuses. Don’t let Hina get away.
 Team II. Report.
 I’ve finished what I had to.
 Roger that. I’ll be joining you soon.
 Trinity and Gehenna… The time has finally come to pay the price for this age-old hatred.
 Yes, in the name of paradise…
 Fade to Black
 … we, Arius, will be the ones to pass judgment on you.
 Fade to Black [Again]
 All key figures of Trinity and Gehenna have been dealt with. You’re the only one that remains, Sensei of Schale.
 …
 Correct--we are Squad. It’s good to finally meet you, and thank you for taking such good care of Azusa.
 She seems to be doing well. We’ll have plenty of time to catch up with her soon enough.
 We signed the treaty on Trinity’s behalf at the Cathedral of Communion.
 Because in the name of paradise, we, Arius’ Squad, will become the Eden Treaty Organization: a new armed force that will guard the treaty’s sanctity.
 It was always meant to be our duty. That was the right to be given to us at the First Council.
 But Trinity saw fit to trample on that duty. We were persecuted and blamed for every conflict of the age--suppressed and made to be scapegoats.
 However, with the ETO’s authority, we now have the power to designate who will be suppressed.
 Gehenna and Trinity have both already defied the treaty in the moments after its signing. They’re targets which must be eliminated.
 Trinity and Gehenna will be erased from Kivotos.
 They will disappear together, just like the commandments’ guardians.
 And everyone will bear witness to the hatred we’ve harbored for the centuries after the First Council.
 But before that, there’s one last element to take care of.
 She said you would be the largest obstacle to our plan.
 BANG
 Sorasaki Hina! How can you still move?!
 Don’t think it’ll be that easy!
 More Gun shots
 That’s fine. Hina may have tried her best to shield Sensei, but I can confirm Sensei was hit.
 They’re not a denizen of Kivotos. Without a halo, it’s only a matter of time before Sensei falls to death’s embrace.
 Still… Why would she go so far to protect Sensei? Are they truly that Important?
 Hmm. Nice of you to join us.
 How have you been, Azusa?
 You already know the answer to that. There's no place for you--neither with Trinity or Schale
 There's no place in the world that accepts murderers like us.
 Even if such a place existed, it would be fleeting and vanish in the blink of an eye... just as your Sensei has now.
 Everything is in vain, so why try to fight it, Shirasu Azusa?
 Even now, you're dozing away in a sweet dream. I have no choice but to wake you up from it, then.
 I'll wake you from those dreams again and again, as many times as it takes.
 Now, come.
 So naive.
 Attacking without thinking. Have you lost your touch, Azusa?
 Guerrilla warfare is your specialty. Outwit and attack the enemy when they’re at their most vulnerable. Are you foolish enough to think you have a chance attacking me head on?
 Another Black Screen [I think this one was a punch]
 How much time do we have?
 That should be enough, Stand her up.
 You saved me the trouble of finding you, Azusa.
 Your betrayal caused us to change our plans somewhat, but in the end, it was nothing we couldn’t account for.
 I expected Mika to join us today, but we have no use for that foolish girl anymore regardless.
 Nagisa was a threat, but even she didn’t suspect what would happen by simply attending the signing ceremony.
 Even the Sisterhood has been disposed of--an added bonus.
 So allow me to answer your questions.
 We’ve stolen the Eden Treaty.
 We dropped a cruise missile on the cathedral playing host to the ceremony, wiped out the zealots, and captured the treaty for ourselves.
 Azusa has a 3 dot speech bubble.
 You seem confused.
 The Saint Justina Council.
 The guardians of the commandments and Trinity’s legendary armed forces.
 To be exact, the ones before are just Mimesises, but they’ll carry out their sacred duty all the same.
 Any hostilities between Trinity and Gehenna will be considered a violation of the divine commandments and will be handled accordingly.
 It’s useless to try to win her over, Hime. This one’s will is too stubborn to be broken so easily.
 That’s right. There’s been someone by her side encouraging that stubbornness, hasn’t there?
 A wicked adult that distorts the truth of this world and has filled your head with lies.
 But now they’ve been dealt with. We can begin re-educating you slowly, from the very beginning. There’s no rush.
 You seemed to be enjoying yourself at Trinity.
 Were you having fun? Did you take a liking to those people and think that they understood you?
 How futile.
 We’re the only ones who could ever understand you. We’re the only ones who would accept the real you. This is where you belong.
 You’ve averted your eyes from the truth and been blinded by nothing but sweet lies. Your weakness is to blame for your defeat.
 Do you wish to stop us?
 Then destroy my halo, Azusa.
 The commandments will last for eternity so long as we, the arbiters of this treaty, still exist.
 There’s no other way to stop us.
 You did your best to wash your hands of the matter. You even tried to deceive us. But in the end, you don’t have what it takes.
 It’s only a matter of time before we find Seia again and finish what you couldn’t.
 What is this? A stuffed animal?
 Explosion!
 …!
 Azusa used Nigerundayo. It is super effective!
 Azusa! Still trying to run away?!
 Azusa…
 …
 We’ve secured the Council.
 Next is Trinity. We’ll use the underground passageways to infiltrate their campus.
 Even if it was just for a time, Azusa came to call that place her home. She sought to replace where she came from with those delusions. So I’ll erase it--there won’t be a single trace left.
 I suppose that would be for the best. Let’s show them just who they’re dealing with.
 Welcome, Trinity--the originators of our suffering--and the contemptible recreants from the pits of Gehenna.
 Hear my words, Council! Follow the orders of the ETO and eliminate these heretics!
 Black Screen
 A tactical weapon, hmm? It’s just a monster.
 And by then it will be too late.
 Contact the units on standby.
 It’s time to advance upon Trinity.
 Fade to black as it goes to various Trinity facilities, catacombs sewers etc. There are also alot of Justina Council Girls.
 Now, for the comm--
 …
 How much time has passed since we were last here?
 …
 It’s her. She’s here.
 DON’T MOVE!
 They’re only meant to disorient us. She’s trying to outwit us.
 Azusa will strike when we’re most vulnerable. We must remain calm.
 BOOM
 Hiyori!
 Black Screen.
 …
 Does this mean she plans on making this a close-quarters fight?
 *click* *click*
 Stop hiding! Shirasu Azusa!
 Azusa appears for a second, then zooms away.
 Do you think you can run?!
 You can’t escape!
 Azusa zooms through the screen, accompanied by Gunfire.
 Clever. You know you can’t defeat me head on, Azusa!
 That’s why your only option is to run.
 Boom!
 Your only hope is to take me by surprise!
 Screen Transition!
 Azusa!
 …
 The Council will only intervene in a conflict between Trinity and Gehenna. They may not acknowledge Azusa as a Trinity Student.
 So they may still recognize her as part of Squad.
 Yes, that’s why we have to settle this on our own.
 I’ve taught her everything she knows--the way she thinks, the way she fights… I’m the best-suited to defeat her.
 Let’s keep up the pursuit.
 Saori Zooms away.
 AZUSAAAAAA!
 More explosions
 Checkmate.
 A valiant effort, but this is the end of the line. I know how you fight, how you think, how you move.
 Resisting was futile from the very beginning.
 …?
 …
 Do you understand why you were defeated, Azusa?
 It’s because you're weak.
 What do you think qualifies someone to be a killer?
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? They must have the intent to kill.
 The Scriptures say the first murder was carried out with but a single stone.
 Now do you get it? It doesn’t matter what tool you use, so long as you have the intent to kill. That is what matters.
 Whether it’s a missile or a stone, they’re only tools to carry out our own animosity. Nothing more, nothing less.
 …?!
 Futile.
 Bang
 You’re weak, Shirasu Azusa. Your weakness is a disease that binds and gnaws at you.
 Just like that stuffed animal you can’t let go of, even now.
 The first gift you ever received from a friend, hmm?
 Futile.
 Saori Lights Azusa up, there are 3 Pictures but I think 1 gets the gist.
 Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile.
 Reload, and one more lighting up.
 Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile.
 Saori can't stop shooting Azusa.
 Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile. Futile.
 It’s futile, Shirasu Azusa.
 Friendship?! It’s nothing but futility and something to be done away with! Her name was Hifumi, was it?
 Stand aside, Hime.
 I’m holding back. I know her limits.
 Azusa gets up and fucking dips away.
 Running again, are you?!
 Boom!
 She got away.
 Well, no matter. She’ll be back.
 She dropped this thing that’s supposed to symbolize their friendship.
 I have no doubt she’ll be back for it.
 Why am I so sure? Because an insect that finds light in the darkness becomes unable to live without it.
 This worthless thing is her light--it’s her hope keeping her going.
 She won’t give it up so easily. Azusa will have no choice but to return.
 And when she does, I’ll capture her and remind her of the truth of this world…
 Fade to black
 …by force if I must.
 Beep Beep Beep.
 Hmm?
 Is there something inside of it?
 …!
 From the Seia operation!
 Hime, run!
 H-Hime?!
 Hime!!!
 Hime, get a hold of yourself…! Atsuko!
 Hime! Are you okay?
 Thank goodness…
 She won’t get away with this.
 Azusa… How are you hurt Hime?
 You’ll pay for this… Azusa!
 Prepare to march on Trinity!
 …
 Fine. We’ll do as you said.
 Now. Let’s go.
 I said now!
 Scene switch to Mika Cage
 Azusa…
 How dare you harm Hime?! You’re going to answer for what you did!
 I’d like to see you try!
 Do you think you can extinguish our animosity?! Our hatred?! Our resentment?!
 AZUSA!
 Why, Azusa?
 Why struggle so much? What are you trying to prove?
 You know as well as I do. All is--
 Azusa stands up
 What’s the use of a pointless struggle?!
 3 Gunshots
 And who are you supposed to be?
 …
 Who are they?
 …
 Think again. Their numbers are meaningless in the face of the continuously growing Council.
 On the contrary--this works out in our favor. Now they can all be taught the lesson Azusa was going to be reminded.
 The truth of this world. They’ll see it is full of malice and hatred, and that life itself is ultimately in vain.
 No one can escape that fate! All is in vain!
 What?!
 ..!
 Many justina members appear and disappear.
 It doesn’t matter!
 Your declaration means nothing! Happy endings?!
 Do you think erasing the hatred and mistrust in the world is that simple?! You’re living in a fantasy! Stop dreaming!
 …!
 Silence!
 Why?! What makes you so different?!
 Black Screen
 We’re cut from the same cloth. We suffered together! We despaired together in this bleak wasteland!
 How is that you and only you can find meaning in a world where everything is in vain?!
 What makes you so special?!
 I refuse to accept it. I reject the meaning you’ve found--every last thing you experienced at Trinity! To hell with it all!
 It’s in vain--all of it!
 …
 No. Not yet.
 There’s still one last hope. Below the old cathedral.
 Saori zooms away.
 Azusa…
 Very well. This is the final battle, so put everything on the line.
 Do you think you have a chance defeating me all by yourself?!
 You! Sensei!
 Fine, then… I’ll rid myself of you and that irksome adult at once!
 Then the truth of this world will be laid bare. All is in vain…
 Gah…
 Shiatsu… Azu…sa…
 THUMB
 *cough* Hime… Why didn’t you run away?
 N-No, Hime! If you speak, she’ll--
 …?
 End…?
 You can’t mean returning to Arius. We’ll be killed if we go back.
 Flee…?
 But… we can’t just leave like this…
 Scene change to Maestro
 What’s going on…?
 *cough* *cough*...
 We can’t return to the district. She’ll have us killed.
 Is there a problem?
 The decision is final. Trust your training and be ready, Azusa.
 The course of history will change tomorrow—for both Arius and Trinity.
 Don't lose sight of your mission. You are to destroy the halo of the Tea Party's leader, Kirifuji Nagisa. Nothing else matters.
 I know you can handle yourself. Just as you did with Seia.
 Azusa.
 Never forget. Vanitas vanitatum.
 …
 Scene change
 Prepare yourselves.
 That's enough.
 See those dark clouds? It's going to rain soon.
 Struggle as much as you like, Azusa, but you can't escape.
 The truth is ingrained into your very being, and you will be reminded of it soon enough.
 It is the prophecy.
 All is in vain. Life is ultimately empty.
 <<To be Continued>>
 (in V3C3) …
 Don’t worry about me. Take a look at this.
 I didn’t ask for your opinion! I’ll distract them. Just get Hime out of here.
 Escape with her…and after that…
 After that…
 Hime?!
 Atsuko?! Are you insane?
 I’ll find somewhere, anywhere. I can protect you, Atsuko!
 No! She’ll kill you, Atsuko! Do you hear me? You’re dead the moment you arrive!
 Atsuko… No… Come back…!
 I have to protect you…
 If I can’t…! If you disappear…!
 What would I do?
 Fade to black
 What do I do without you, Atsuko?
 What the hell have I been doing all this time?
 Is there anything for me…to live for?

 02 - Uncomfortable Reception
 In the name of helping the Tea Party, Sakurako from Sisterhood and Mine from the Remedial Knights join Nagisa. During an awkward tea party, Nagisa informs Sensei that Mika’s hearing will be held the next day, where she will likely be expelled.

 07 - Choices and Decisions
 Seia’s condition worsens, and Mika is accused of hurting her. Meanwhile, Saori kneels in front of Sensei, begging for help to save Atsuko. Saori offers the halo-shattering bomb as collateral, but Sensei agrees to help and destroys the gift. Mika concludes that all her misfortune was because of Saori and escapes Trinity to seek revenge.
 (Mika in scene)

 Black screen
 Gun and hat drops
 …
 …Sensei.
 Hime… They took Atsuko.
 And then they attacked us… I was separated in the fight… I don’t know what happened to them.
 I’ve been running from Arius…for days on end…
 I was utterly useless.
 Please… Atsuko… Atsuko is going to die!
 Tomorrow at sunrise, she’ll execute Atsuko!
 I have no right to ask you to believe me… but I beg of you…
 Atsuko was raised for the express purpose of this moment…
 I don’t know the details, but it was her fate to die since she was born.
 She said…
 I could change Hime’s fate…if I just faithfully carried out her orders.
 She said I could…save not only Hime…but others too.
 She made me a promise. If I stole the Eden Treaty and granted Arius the power of the Saint Justina Council… If I could seize the Trinity and Gehenna districts…
 Atsuko wouldn’t have to die.
 In the end…
 I failed.
 I failed the Arius Squad.
 We failed to steal the Eden Treaty.
 We couldn’t conquer the Trinity and Gehenna districts.
 We couldn’t save our colleagues.
 I couldn’t protect Atsuko! Damn it!
 I was useless. I failed.
 There’s no one I can turn to for help. Trinity, Gehenna, and even Arius are out for my blood.
 I don’t know who else to ask… [NAME] Sensei… No one else can save her.
 Please…
 I’ll do anything. I still have a bomb that destroys halos. I’m putting my life in your hands.
 You can use this to kill me.
 If you even so much as suspect me, you can kill me.
 …
 Please…help Atsuko…
 I beg of you…
 Fade to black

 B-But…

 The representative of the Arius district and owner of the Arius Satellite School. We usually call her ‘she,’ but also ‘Madame.’
 I’ve only seen her a few times…but she’s a tall adult with a red dress…
 Her name is Beatrice. Hime was the one who interacted with her a lot.
 After she took Hime, we were attacked…and got separated. I haven’t been able to find them.
 They’re probably still on the run.
 The Arius basilica…in the Arius district. There’s a secret holy place she’s prepared for this moment. Atsuko must be there.
 I don’t know what it’s for. Just that it’s been prepared for Hime for a long time.
 Hime always said that was where she would meet her end.
 Beatrice said the ceremony would be at sunrise tomorrow.
 Please, Time is running out for Hime.
 …
 What?
 Really?! You’re choosing to help me?
 Y-Yes…but… I didn’t expect you to…
 Have you already forgotten? I shot you!
 Why in the hell would you help someone who put a bullet through you?
 Oh… Um… Okay.
 Saori gives the detonator
 This is the detonator. If you press this…
 Y-You want me to remove the bomb? Your insurance?
 I don’t know what your play is here…
 But don’t worry. It won’t explode without the detonator.
 …?
 Wh-What…?!
 …
 Wh-What’s going on…? H-Huh? What…?
 Sensei! What is wrong with you?!
 Fade to black
 H-Hold on…!
 <<To be Continued>>
 08 - Squad Reunion
 Sensei and Saori start looking for the scattered members of the Arius Squad. They find Hiyori hiding in a slum, and Misaki standing on the railing of a bridge. They successfully convinces Misaki to go to the Arius District with everyone to rescue Atsuko.
 Hiyori! Are you injured?
 Hiyori comes out
 That’s…
 …
 Hiyori…
 They’re not lying, Hiyori. Sensei decided to help us.
 …!
 I see.
 I think you should do it, Hiyori.
 Tell her where I am, so she’ll let you return to the district. Keep yourself safe.
 It won’t stop me from trying to save Atsuko. You’ve done enough.
 I’ve always understood this day would come. Thank you for meeting my demands all this time.
 Yeah. We have to save her, no matter what.
 We’ll find Misaki and figure out a plan.
 I think I’m thinking of the same place…
 …
 Misaki.
 Yes, I did. Eliminate Sensei and earn her forgiveness.
 …
 …
 …
 Misaki steps back further
 You can shut the hell up, Misaki.
 You think this pathetic display will finally bring you peace? End your suffering? You think I would humor this?
 Listen, Misaki. If you jump, here’s what I’m gonna do.
 I’m gonna take off my coat and jump off the bridge after you. You know I’ll catch up to you.
 I’m sure you put rocks in your coat, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll tear it off you and drag you out of the water.
 That’ll take me about twenty seconds. If you’re unconscious, I’ll give you CPR until you wake up.
 You can’t pull one over me like that, Misaki.
 I’ve never let you get away with it before. What makes you think I’ll start now?
 As usual, I leave my back to you.
 We have to move fast, Sensei. The clock is ticking.
 I’ll explain as we go. Let’s leave.
 You’ll be lost in the catacombs until you starve if you choose the wrong entrance.
 So we’ve been receiving and deciphering code for the internal route that leads from the real entrance to the catacomb to the Arius district.
 There’s no reason to show a runaway hound the way home.
 If it chooses, we have no way of returning to Arius.
 Even if we were to find away, it wouldn’t be in time to save Hime.
 Commencing assault.
 Show them how sharp our fangs are!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 Misaki and Hiyori are pleasantly surprised at how much smoother combat is under Sensei’s command. Saori presses them to continue and they head to Trinity’s underground catacombs.
 Not if we keep stopping to chat. Let’s move.
 Be on guard. She’ll stop at nothing.
 We’re charging through.
 There will be well-trained, elite soldiers waiting for us.
 We’ll lead the way. Sensei, follow closely behind.
 We must beat them here if we have any hope of saving Hime.
 Let’s tear them apart!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 (Mika appears during the battle and defeats the boss)
 Just as they finish defeating the Arius students in their way, there’s an explosion and a new pursuer, Misono Mika, appears in front of the Arius Squad and Sensei.
 Multiple Arius students fall as Mika shows herself
 Misono Mika…
 Misono Mika…
 You did appear out of nowhere after apparently breaking out of prison.
 …
 *whisper* Where is Sensei?
 How long until the passage closes?
 …
 No. We’ll lose our only opportunity to get to Arius.
 That’s…
 Scatter! Don’t fight head-to-head!

 Ugh.

 You’re right. Sensei, please stay close. The path is complicated from here.
 I’m hoping to avoid that outcome. Arius is this way.
 *pant* *pant*

 *pant* *pant*
 *gulp* *pant pant*
 I could change Hime’s fate…if I just faithfully carried out her orders.
 She said I could…save not only Hime…but the others too.
 I enjoyed your story.
 I can. I’m sorry to have inconvenienced all of you.
 No matter what.
 Our goal remains the same. We’ll go to the Arius basilica and rescue Hime.
 I’ve considered that. So, we’re going through the Arius Satellite School’s former institute.
 !!
 Hime once told me that when the Council built the original Arius Academy building, they made an underground corridor between the basilica and the academy.
 The corridor is ancient history, so I doubt if she even knows of it.
 We’ll slip into the basilica unnoticed if all goes well.
 I’ve only heard of it from Hime. We’ll have to find it somehow.
 The former institute isn’t far from here, but don’t blow our cover. Or we’ll miss our chance to save Hime.
 Does it feel a little too quiet to anyone else? I’ve never seen it so abandoned.
 …
 …
 Isn’t that..?
 How can they be here? Sensei canceled our contract.
 Yes… We failed both securing the Mimesis ability and occupying the academies.
 But…she’d already secured the Mimesis ability…?
 So, that means…
 It had…nothing to do with saving Hime?
 Then was the meaning of all this? All this pain…
 Black screen
 How did you…
 …Madame.
 …
 …
 …?!
 I was only obedient to keep Hime safe! You lied to us.
 U-Ugh!

 BEATRICE!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 Mika suddenly appears, defeats the Council’s boss, and fights against the Arius Squad.
 Mika?! How did you get here?
 …
 *pant* *pant*
 …
 …
 Mika really…hates me to her core.
 I can’t blame her for thinking I’m shameless. But I’m doing what I must.
 It doesn’t matter what the odds are. We enter the basilica through the former institute, just as we planned.
 There’s no time left. We have to throw caution to the wind.
 Saori leaves
 This way.
 Let’s go. We need to get to the underground corridor.
 [Former Institute Underground Corridor]
 Great job, Hiyori.
 I’ve thought about the possibility of an ambush. Considering it’s a straight line…
 I’m here. On the other side of the pillar.
 I made it out okay. Just on the wrong side.
 I think I’ll have to take a rain check on that.
 …
 ……
 One hour left until sunrise…
 ……
 …I was just reminiscing.
 ?
 ……
 Sensei!! Don’t come help me!!
 I’ll be okay! Go to Atsuko!
 There’s no time left. Please! Save Hime!
 ……
 …Was this what you wanted, Mika?
 ……
 ……
 ……
 …I do understand.
 ?!
 Saori drops a grenade
 It’s a weapon that’s been banned from production. I found it at the Arius training grounds.
 …This isn’t our first fight. I know how to handle you.
 Gunfire
 Mika falls
 As I said, I understand your hatred, Mika.
 If not for me, you would still have your Tea Party, your friends…the future you were meant to have.
 I also understand that it’s my responsibility to bear that hatred.
 I’ve learned that, even if all is in vain, there’s still a reason to fight.
 Back to scene
 This way, Hiyori, Misaki. Let’s hide here.
 Be quiet. Lower your head.
 I don’t know… She must be super important.
 I don’t care how heartwarming it is! You’re gonna give us away!
 …?
 Stop, Misaki. You’re scaring Hiyori.
 Of course not. Crowds like these are the perfect hunting grounds. Steal everything you can get your hands on.
 Got it? Let’s go.
 Fade to black
 Gunshots accompanied with a fall
 Stop!
 You’re going to destroy her halo! Please!
 W-Wait!
 I-I’ll teach her!
 I-I’m good at teaching! Hiyori, Misaki, and Hime have all improved their grades since I started helping them.
 I’ll make sure she stays in line! So, Please…!

 Misaki, don’t do this again. Please.
 W-Why not…? B-Because…well…

 It’s because…
 M-Misaki! No, wait!
 Wait! I-I…

 P-Please forgive me… I was wrong… I’m sorry…
 I’m sorry…sorry…so sorry… I’ll never…
 I’ll never disobey an adult’s order…never ever… I’ll let go of all hope… I won’t rebel.
 I will never pray for happiness… Never again… I’m sorry…
 So, please…forgive…
 Fade to black
 Have mercy…please…
 Mercy…
 Why do you continue to resist, Azusa?
 A symbol of reconciliation? It was a fool’s dream. A lie. It’s not like you to believe in lies.
 Real truth lies in your training, in the lessons we have learned here.
 Let go of all hope. Don’t rebel. Don’t pray for happiness. Everything is in vain.
 Azusa! Are you listening?!
 Wh-What? What did you say?
 Fade to white
 Where are you going? Come back… Azusa!
 Tell me…please! What did you say? Don’t…Don’t leave us.
 Azusa…
 Have you…found your answer?
 Please…what do you know? I…
 What should I do?
 Azusa…
 A-Argh…!
 U-Ugh…
 Saori falls
 …This is it, then.
 I guess this ending was already written in stone.
 Black screen
 …It’s fine.
 Back to scene
 My ending. I ran out of pages a long time ago.
 I kept running forward, believing with all my heart I was doing what I had to do. But that didn’t make it right.
 …?
 …You heard that?
 Azusa… She…
 She was never meant to be a spy.
 At first, she was…
 She was a symbol of reconciliation.
 Reconciliation for Trinity and Arius… That was your idea, Mika.
 No. You don’t remember? You said it when you first approached us.
 Before Seia’s attack. Before the Eden Treaty, before the coup… Before the lies and schemes.
 When we first met, you only spoke of peace.
 <<Flashback sequence>>
 Get to the point, Trinity.
 …What?
 ……
 …Do you expect me to trust you?
 ……
 You’re insane. Your plan is insanity.
 …
 This isn’t a decision I can make. We’ll talk again later.
 …
 Saori leaves
 ?
 Azusa. It’s a mission.
 You don’t want to…try?
 ……
 …Of course not, Madame.
 …Trinity.
 Yes, Madame. I will not.
 I don’t know what it was about her…but I thought Azusa…
 I thought she could be that symbol for the academies.
 But we’ll never know what could’ve become of that future.
 <<Flashback sequence>>
 Madame wanted Seia gone, and the opportunity presented itself.
 You only thought of us as disposable foot soldiers, didn’t you? Why else would you have revealed Seia’s location?
 But we weren’t some petty thieves you could manipulate.
 We’re murderers. Day in and day out, we trained to destroy halos.
 Fade to black
 And then we received a mission… Shatter Seia’s halo.
 Fade to black
 And Azusa…she was assigned to the mission because she’d already studied and prepared to be our symbol of reconciliation.
 ……
 You…
 I didn’t understand what you wanted or what principles you upheld. I still don't.
 I could've just brushed you off as a foolish, naive girl. But I know you better than that.
 I thought your dreams of reconciliation were inconceivable, but…
 But what if it wasn’t? What if we could emerge from the shadows?
 Even now, I can’t erase the thoughts from my head.
 Mika…
 When you first approached me, you really did want to reconcile, didn’t you?
 You came to us with the best interests, but I deceived you and dragged you into hell.
 You couldn’t accept it…the hell that erupted from your hopeful dreams. So, you locked away your memories and embraced the darkness you believed lived inside you.
 And you’re not the only one.
 Hiyori and Misaki were dragged into Squad, and Hime…she never should have had to fight here.
 Azusa was forced to return to Trinity, not as the symbol of reconciliation we’d hoped for, but as a murderer and spy.
 All this, because of me. Because of my weakness.
 Black screen
 Why do you always call me? A hound…
 Yes. A rabid hound. One that infects everyone around it.
 …
 Back to scene
 Why did I call out for Azusa? I have…so many questions for her.
 Azusa was a victim of circumstance. She suffered the most in some ways, and yet…
 …she seemed so happy.
 Azusa was always closed-off. She accepted her presence, but never our friendship.
 Her loneliness was palpable.
 But then she actually went to Trinity. She went and made friends, met a nice adult…
 Azusa overcame all her hardships and suffering with a smile.
 She seemed content, in that world beneath a blue sky I could never reach.
 Fade to black
 It’s a lie. Don’t you understand? There can be no peace.
 Your hope? It’s an illusion! It’ll disappear with the setting sun!!
 I’ve prayed! I’ve dreamed and hoped! I’ve lived and loved, and nothing has ever changed!
 Everything is in vain, Azusa! Everything!
 Fade to black
 But in the end…
 She was right, in the end.
 Everything I believed in…my hatred, my resolve…
 It was all a lie. Everything isn’t in vain.
 My weakness was everyone’s undoing.
 Black screen
 It was all my fault, Mika.
 Azusa couldn’t find happiness until she finally escaped…me.
 You know the lengths I went to deny that simple fact.
 I want to know…what Azusa has learned. The answers she found at Trinity.
 I have so many questions for her.
 Black screen
 …Can I be happy too, one day?
 How can I find peace? Will I ever have the chance? Or more aptly…do I deserve the chance?
 What if…
 Fade to black
 What if I had met Sensei first? Instead of Madame?
 How would the trajectory of my life have changed?
 Maybe I wouldn’t have hurt everyone I love.
 If I had…the chance to be good…
 I want to understand those words you said to me, Azusa.
 I want…
 Saori falls
 It doesn’t matter anymore… Mika.
 Take your revenge. Claim as much as you’ve lost.
 You were never a witch. I was the one who injected my hate into your veins.
 I’ve took so much from everyone around me. This ending is only fitting.
 Fade to black
 Well.. I always thought it would be Azusa, but it’s for the best if it’s you, Mika.
 …
 Mika drops her weapon
 …
 ……
 Mika…
 …!
 I don’t have it.
 Sensei confiscated it from me.
 Sensei…?!
 Sensei?! I thought you were going to rescue Hime!
 …!
 Misaki… Hiyori..
 ….
 …
 Atsuko! No!
 I'll never let you! Hime, I'm coming!
 Ugh... That thing…
 Well, we'll have to try! It's coming!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 <<To be Continued>>
 21 - Breakthrough
 Mika sacrifices herself to protect Sensei and the Arius Squad from the Council. Leaving her behind, the rest rush forward to rescue Atsuko.
 You…
 ...Don't die.
 …
 She'll be fine. Let's hurry.
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 The Arius Squad and Sensei arrive at the basilica sanctuary and confronting Beatrice.
 *pant* *pant*
 Hime!
 …!
 …!
 Madame's real identity…
 Yes.
 ...I'm not scared of her.
 *pant* *pant*
 You can still stand, can't you? Pick up your weapons!
 Get to her, before reinforcements get here!
 …!
 Yes, Madame.
 My Arius Squad... I would sacrifice myself a thousand times over to make up for what I've done to all of you.
 Well, Madame? Come and get me!
 BEATRICE!!!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 Beatrice is defeated by the Arius Squad and Sensei. The Arius Squad rescues Atsuko, who's been freed from Beatrice's ritual. Then Golconde, a member of Gematria, appears in front of them and disappears with Beatrice.
 *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...
 Atsuko! No!
 Hime! Hime! Wake up! P-Please...wake up…
 Hime... A-Atsuko... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...so please, just open your eyes... I'll do anything…
 Don't...d-don't leave me. Hime...!
 A-Atsuko! Yes! Yes, it's me!
 Welcome back, Atsuko. You're home.
 Hime. Y—You're alive. You're okay.
 I can feel you in my arms, so I can believe it. Thank you... Thank you for surviving, Atsuko.
 *sob*
 Yes. If it weren't for them…
 Thank you, Sensei. Everything's okay now, Saori. I can feel it.
 Yes…
 Beatrice…
 She got away?
 …
 …
 Okay. Sensei.
 We saved Hime. You can do whatever you need to now.
 I was the culprit behind everything... The Eden Treaty incident, the Seia and Nagisa attacks... Misaki, Hiyori, and Atsuko's pain... I'm responsible for all of it.
 The General Student Council, Trinity...or the Corrections Bureau... Send me wherever you think is fitting.
 No... I've done too much harm with no consequences.
 But I'm ready now. I want to take responsibility.
 …
 What are you saying? That's...!
 Then... What do I do? What am I supposed to do now, Sensei?
 Live...? I don't understand.
 Hime?
 Azusa said she liked learning and spending time with her friends.
 I’ve never…
 I don't know... I've never thought about anything like that before…
 What I like? What I want? They're foreign concepts to me…
 …
 …!
 But I can't fathom having a future at all, let alone what I would do with it.
 …
 I've never thought about life beyond surviving the current moment. I don't know what that means...to just live.
 I…
 Do I deserve...to dream of a future?
 …
 You're leaving? S-Sensei!
 W-Wait. I'm not ready…
 I… We…
 …
 No, you’re right.
 I'll find the answer on my own.
 …!
 Black screen with footsteps
 Back to scene
 Last time?
 …
 I'm okay. I'm confused, and I don't really understand everything Sensei said yet.
 But for the first time in my life, I feel like it's okay for me to be alive.

 Saori walks away
 Give me an expensive mission. The hardest one you have.
 Fade to black
 (I'm a criminal on the run now. I know it won't be easy.)
 (But there has to be an end to the road of pain I've walked all these years.)
 (Is there a happy future for us if I reach it?)
 This isn't what I'm owed!
 What's with this? This isn't even half of what I was promised!
 What? Wait, that's…
 What? Wait, then...how much do I get...?
 Keyboard clicking
 ...No, I get it.
 I'll consider this lesson learned.
 Knocking
 ?
 …
 ...It's not a big deal.
 Is this how the criminal world operates?
