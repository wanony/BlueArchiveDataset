 Heeheehee. What's your story, newbie? No one ends up here without one.
 Not the talkative type? Eh, I don't care either way as long as you're skilled. What kind of request you looking for? Easy or hard?
 Hm? I don't follow.
 You're the one who broke our promise.
 It says right here on the contract, student pay is a thousand yen.
 But you hid the fact you were a dropout, so it's five hundred yen.
 This is the calculation after subtracting taxes, various expenses, and meals. Any problems?
 Also, it looks like you're wanted. Wouldn't you get in trouble if anyone knew you were here?
 I'll have to deduct an additional fifteen percent as an information protection cost.
 Zilch. Nada. Nothing.
 The exit is right that way.
 Do you have any complaints? I'm sure you could direct them to the Valkyrie Police Academy.
 â€¦
 Oh, you're...the one I gave the commission to last time...?!
 Forgot something? But we've already finished the calculations.
 Forgive?
 UNFORGIVABLE!!!
