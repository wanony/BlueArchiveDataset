 They should be here by now.
 Ah, yes! I’m glad you found it!
 I’m so happy Sensei set this up for me! You must be…
 …The Bento Disposal Specialists!
 Yes! Our convenience store isn’t the most popular, so we end up having a lot of old product.
 Usually I have to get rid of them myself, but it’s a lot of work for someone as small as me.
 So when Sensei told me they found some people to come dispose of them for me, I was so happy! They’re right here.
 …
 Oh no! Did I offend you? Oh my gosh, are you not the disposal specialists?
 Oh, that’s a relief… But th-the looks on your faces are a little scary right now…
 Oh yes, of course! Let me bring you everything right now!
