 It’s ready!
 Urawa Hanako? Who let you in?!
 I-It’s Sensei…
 How are you feeling, Miss Nagisa?
 As are we. Please take your time to recover.
 No… Actually, I was meant to deliver this letter. It’s from Miss Mika.
 Um, well…
 It flashes back to Mika.
 How would you like us to… answer her requests? She doesn’t seem to be taking her imprisonment very seriously.
 C-Cake rolls?!
 Fade to the Sisterhood.
 Also the Justice Task Force.
 Then Suzumi…
 Then Sena…
 Then to the Prefect Team,
 Then to the Prefect Team again, Hina and Ako.
 Then to Juri and Fuuka…
 Then to the Gourmet research club.
 Then to the Remedial Knights…
 Be ready, Hanako. There will almost certainly be a seat open for you at the Tea Party next year.
 Next scene
 Y-You called, ma’am?
 M-Mika? I will request Nagisa’s approval to do so.
 Yes ma’am!
