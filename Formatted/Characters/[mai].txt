 With the Security and Public Peace Bureaus down, Valkyrie Police School’s last chess piece is the Public Safety Bureau!
 As more doubts pile up, apprehension is thick amongst the citizens!
 They couldn’t even capture the culprit, and now are taking it out on reporters. How shameful!
 The world was shocked to hear that the police school entrusted with protecting the public would debase themselves to a petty mercenary group for their own private interests!
 This organization, supposed to keep the citizens safe, couldn’t even protect their own home base!
 As more doubts pile up, apprehension is thick amongst the citizens!
 The Feral Hound of Valkyrie is now threatening the media in a rage!
 Shinon! Don’t you think it’s time we retreat too?!
