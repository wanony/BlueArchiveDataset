 Don’t say weird stuff like that. You’re embarrassing Sensei.
 Thank Goodness, I thought I was an accessory to murder after that FlyStation she
 threw out the window hit you on the head.
 Let me apologize on her behalf.
 Th-That’s simply because it’s the Game Development Department’s most valuable
 asset. I blurted that out without thinking
 Um, anyway!
 So, Sensei. You represent schale, right
 We’re glad you came.
 And I’m Midori: Illustrator and the one in charge of all game visuals.
 Th–That’s right! Tales Saga Chronicle won top prize at a competition!
 …
 Do you mean like winning accolades?
 Ugh.
 Wh–What are you talking about?
 Momoi…
 It’s a long shot, but don’t you think it’d be easier to recruit another member than it would be to develop a new game?
 …
 You can’t blame Yuuka… We’re the ones who are breaking the rules that apply to all the other clubs.
 Oh, right. What’s this “secret weapon” you mentioned Yuuka?
 Momoi…
 Hey, Momoi?
 How much longer do we have to stay like this?
 This isn’t good at all!
 What is this place? it’s crawling with weird robots!
 Why are all of these robots here?
 What reason would they gave to be guarding the ruins?
 Do you mean the president who presides over all the others? The one who suddenly disappeared?
 Himari? Do you mean that pretty upperclassmen from Veritas that uses a wheelchair?
 She gives me all–knowing RPG sage vibes. If even she doesn’t know…then this place is really mysterious.
 But what makes you think the G.BIBLE is here…? Wait a second!
 Don’t tell me that you jumped to the conclusion that G.BIBLE is here just because of what Himari said!
 That means…?!
 That sounds like a marketing tactic for a game development school or something.
 Ah! Robots?!
 Th–They’re so aggressive! How many robots are there?!
 We’ll be surrounded at this rate!
 Huh? Factory?
 Sensei! Please lead us into the battle!
 >>Battle<<
 <<To be continued…>>
 Episode 4 | On That Day, We Met a Girl
 [???]
 I can’t take this anymore! What did we do to deserve to be chased by robots?!
 This is your fault!
 Did the Prime Student Council restrict access to the ruins because they knew about the robots?
 Where’s that voice coming from?
 What’s going on?
 Whoa!
 No, Sensei looks just as confused as we do
 Bottom door? Is that not the one in front of us?
 That can’t be. it’s just an ordinary floor
 *clank*
 Oh. It did mean that. W–We’re falling!
 Momoi! Sensei! Aaaaahhhh!
 …
 Ugh…
 *gasp* Momoi? Sensei?!
 Are you okay, Momoi? Where’s Sensei…?
 Aaaah! Wh–What are you doing down there?!
 O–Oh. I guess I was so frazzled that I jumped to conclusions.
 A–Anyway…thanks for your help.
 Is something wrong Momoi?
 Huh?!
 What’s she doing down here? Is she asleep?
 Don’t say that! I don’t think that’s a corpse. Take a closer look
 She doesn’t look injured. More like…destroyed.
 No, wait. That’s not a letter. It’s actually…AL–1S
 Who is this girl ? And now what’s this place supposed to be?
 If she wakes up, that is. Let’s give her some clothes first. I feel bad leaving her like this.
 No, They’re mine. The kitty face in the front is different
 *rustle* Okay. All done.
 *be–beep beep*
 Huh?
 It sounded like some kind of alarm… Are there any robots nearby?
 What? Could it be…?
 Status update, Contact with approved subject detected. Dormant state deactivated
 Sh–She opened her eyes!
 That’s what we were going to ask you! Who are you? What IS this place?!
 What does that mean? And…you’re not going to attack us, are you?
 What do we do, Sensei?
 Deep consciousness? What does that mean?
 I…really don’t like where you’re going with this
 What are you thinking?!
 Why did you bring her to the club room?!
 Ah! Don't put that in your mouth! Spit it out!
 I know that…
 …but shouldn't we submit a response about her to the Prime Student Council or Valkyrie?
 W–Wait! You said her name was that AL–1S. Where did you get “Aris” from?
 Well, as long as she’s fine with it
 Momoi Now, let’s move on to the next step
 You can’t be serious. this isn’t as simple as adopting a cat!
 Huh? It was to make a good game so we can keep our club.
 But I thought you said it was the only way. We haven’t had any luck recruiting people to work on a retro game.
 Hold on…
 Momoi. Don’t tell me…
 You’re thinking of disguising her as a Millennium student and having her join our club!
 *sigh*
 I Hope this works.
 <<To be continued…>>
 Episode 5 | I, Aris…
 [Millennium Game Development Department]
 I don't know about this.
 Will it really be okay if we disguise her as a club member?
 There’s no way this will work! She’ll blow her cover the second she opens her mouth!
 It’s hopeless. We can’t pull something like this off!
 …
 That’s true…
 A conversation? What do you mean?
 I mean, sure, but…
 *sigh*
 Okay, then. I’ll try.
 W–Wait!
 Um…
 Uh, so…Aris?
 Hmm… I don’t even know how I learned to make conversation. I suppose I just picked it up from watching TV or hearing other people talk.
 Hmm. Maybe I can find an educational program for kids online.
 Huh?
 Y-You mean that?!
 Oh. That. It’s a little embarrassing, but it has an article about a game we made. It got a lot of really bad reviews.
 Oh, right!
 I’m not proud of the fact it won Worst Game of the Year…
 …but why don’t you give it a try, Aris?
 There are all kinds of conversations in the game, so it might be a good opportunity to learn.
 Really?! Give me just a minute. I’ll set it up for you!
 Okay, it’s ready!
 As the title suggests, our game is a classic fantasy RPG with a rich, fairy tale atmosphere.
 <Cosmic Calendar Year 2354. Mankind is engulfed in the flames of retribution>
 Well…it does take inspiration from some other genres’ trends too. Sticking with the same tired tropes can get boring after a while.
 What are you doing here Momoi? I thought you were going to get the student ID
 Anyway, on second thought, I think the way we designed this scene is a little unfair.
 I’m going to guess it’s “rage”.
 <weapon equipped successfully>
 I don't think that’s the biggest issue here.
 A-Are you okay, Aris?
 Ugh. We really messed up on this part…
 It’s supposed to say that he prefers meat, but we couldn’t find the right words…
 When he says, “Sorry I can’t help you ladies with those veggies, I’m more of a sausage lover myself,” Aris’ circuits almost got fried!
 A-Aris! Are you alright? You’re almost to the climax!
 By the way, momoi…
 Have you noticed the more Aris plays…
 …the weirder the way she talks has become?
 It’s definitely awkward, but it sure beats her just listing words out!
 U-Um so…
 I have a kind of embarrassing question for you, Aris.
 How was our game? Did you have fun?!
 P-Please don’t be a curse word.
 A-Aris, why are you crying?
 But our game is just a comedy RPG…
 Eeek! A gh-ghost!
 We couldn’t find you anywhere! How long have you been hiding in the cabinet?
 That was a long time ago! Oh, were you scared of Aris or something?
 You should have said something . Aris and I could have stepped out if you needed us to
 Yuzu…
 <<To be continued…>>
 Episode 6 | How to learn a Language
 [Millenium Game Development Department]
 huh?~ Aris is new to games, though! The Legend of Zinda: Lonk’s Awakening is the obvious choice for a noob!
 Hey, Aris, let’s try Stratagem Oger next! I’ll introduce you to the world of tactics games!
 Zzz…
 Ughhh…
 M-Morning already?! Oh, no! I have to get ready for school!
 Huh?!
 Aris! you can speak normally now!
 H-Haha. I-I guess there’s still some room for improvement.
 Maybe it’s actually kinda cool that she talks like she’s in a retro game…
 I-Is this really gonna work?
 It’s a club of experts who make and repair machines here at MIllenium.
 Their members are called meisters.
 …
 It sounds impressive. Please tell us.
 What do you think Aris–wait, where did she go?
 Oh, hello again, Kotori. What is this huge thing here?
 It kind of looks like…a cannon.
 Didn’t a lot of people get horrible colds when you tried making that cryo-sleep hibernation device?
 Me too! If anyone can do it, it’s the Engineering Club!
 Another overblown name…
 I-I’ve never seen her so excited
 I-I think she wants to know if you’re serious about what you just said.
 Is that really okay, Utaha?
 What’s Utaha up to?
 W-We just wanted a weapon for Aris…
 Wh-What does that mean?
 I don’t understand…
 Eeek!
 >>Battle<<
 Phew, everything worked itself out
 Can we really afford to take it easy?
 Did you talk to Yuuka and tell her we have four members now?
 We’re in danger in real life too! Screening her eligibility?! What does that even mean?
 The survival of our club is on the line, and you’re raiding in an MMO!
 Huh?
 Oooh. That was actually pretty good.
 Are we going to make it through this…?
 Yuuka…
 (I-Is she onto us?!)
 (Nice you’re doing great, Aris!)
 (Wh-Wh-What do w-we do?!)
 Then that means…?!
 We did it!
 Wh-What did you say?!
 Huh?!
 Yuuka So the onus to comply with the change falls to you.
 Huh?!
 She’s gone…
 …
 Hmm…
 So in the end, we’re still in big trouble.
 I-It’s not your fault, Yuzu! Momoi was supposed to go in your place if you couldn’t make it!
 Delete that game right now!
 Ugh… There’s only one option left.
 We have to make a game that we can take to the Millennium Prize.
 Huh? What was that, Yuzu?
 B-But you haven’t left the school building in half a year. You’ve taken every class online!
 Yuzu…
 Aris. Make sure your weapon and equipment is ready!
 …
 Right
 We’ll protect this club room together!
 <<To be continued…>>
 Episode 10 | Back To the Ruins
 [The Ruins]
 They’re tougher than we thought. Are you okay, Sensei?!
 …
 Aris!
 It’s your time to shine!
 That was amazing!
 There’s more…! We should run away, or Sensei will be in danger…
 What are you saying?!
 B-But Momoi…
 Huh? But how?!
 You think we can win a gun fight because we’re good at an MMO?!
 But what about Sensei! We might be okay, but Sensei could be in a lot of danger!
 Huh?
 *sigh* fine, fine! I get it already!
 Prepare to breach their ranks!
 Please lead the charge Sensei!
 >>Battle<<
 <<To be continued…>>
 Episode 11 | Right There, In That Place
 [Inside the factory]
 *pant pant*...Did we make it?
 You’re nuts, we’d never beat C&C…but you’re right. We’re actually pretty good…
 Maybe it’s because Sensei is leading us!
 Oh, how’s our ammo supply doing?
 Like that computer over there, you mean? Huh?
 Uhhh…isn’t this kind of suspicious? What’s the Divi:Sion System, anyway? Could that refer to this munitions factory?
 Whoa!
 W-Wait!
 Something’s weird about this. I don't think you should hit enter. Aris…
 <Voice recognition confirmed. Access granted. Welcome back, AL-1S.>
 Why even have a keyboard?!
 Um, sorry, Yuzu. I should’ve told you earlier.
 It’s really taking its time…
 H-Huh? What was it saying?
 <That’s…>
 <…>
 <An emergency situation has occurred>
 <Power down imminent>
 <Power down imminent. All data will be lost in power down. 51 seconds remain.>
 Yes!
 <G.BIBLE verify complete. Game code identified. For human comprehension and reference, data registry will be discarded. 35 seconds remain…>
 huh…? Did it run out of power?
 W-Wait!
 There’s something on the screen…
 <Transfer complete.>
 I-If the password isn’t too complicated…then Veritas can figure it out?
 We can actually make Tales Saga Chronicles 2…fun…
 Shhh! If you keep yelling like that–
 Of course they heard you…
 Momoi, the console!
 Let’s do this!
 It’s finally time…
 Momoi! You were supposed to ask them to figure out the password to the G.BIBLE!
 Maki is?
 Don’t worry about her. Please tell us about the G.BIBLE.
 Yes!
 That means…!
 A-Amazing!
 Do I have this right? You need this Mirror thing to open the G.BIBLE? Where is it now?
 Is this Mirror thing as dangerous as a wiretap?
 You mean Himari?
 She’s the president of Veritas. Even though she’s wheelchair-bound because of her health, Himari’s not one to be underestimated or pitied.
 She’s a genius known for being the only three students in Millennium to receive the Omniscience Award.
 Riiiiight…
 Wait. You don’t mean…?
 A-Are you guys seriously suggesting…
 …we attack the Student Council with Veritas?
 …
 [Millennium Rooftop]
 The maid Club…?
 The president of the Maid Club, Callsign Double O, Neru.
 …
 Let’s do it, Momoi.
 I know, but…I’m not just going to give up.
 Our club room’s old and leaky, but…
 …it’s not just where we get together to play games anymore
 It’s…where we all belong.
 If we can avoid fighting the Maid Club…I think we have a chance.
 no, even if we have to fight them!
 I want to keep it safe.
 For Aris and Yuzu and all of us together/
 Wait, really?
 But hasn’t the Engineering Club already qualified to be renewed?
 Then why would you team up with us to take on the Maid Club?
 Huh?
 Uhhh, okay.
 Anyway, here’s to a fruitful partnership!
 [Millennium - Veritas]
 Stay strong, Aris… We’ll save you soon
 Sh-Should we get started?
 *sigh* I’m so nervous.
 I haven’t felt like this since we invaded the Ancient History Research Society building.
 Is it really, though?
 Well, if Kotori and Maki are ready…
 Sound us off, Sensei!
 Right!
 What does that mean?
 Ugh. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around all this. Let me get this straight.
 The only way to move between floors is by elevator.
 The area upstairs is equipped with fingerprint-based security devices, which, when triggered, activate heavy shutters that section off the area.
 Furthermore, failing to get through the security triggers an even more powerful shutter.
 This isn’t right, Doesn't it seem like we’re in too deep?
 *gasp* It’s Akane!
 …
 Do you think it would have been better for us to just play the pre-recorded footage of an empty hallway while we grab the Mirror?
 Wait a second… Sensei, it’s pretty dark, so grab ahold of our hands.
 Okay then…Ready!
 Sensei! Momoi! We’ve received a communication from Hare! The plan to trap Akane worked!
 Thank goodness the Engineering Club was able to trick that manufacturer into being the go-between seller for their new security system.
 Hmm? Didn’t something like this happen not that long ago…?
 Hare looked all over Millennium but couldn’t find her. Maybe she’s outside the academy?
 S-Sensei?!
 Sensei… You’re actually serious?
 …
 A 13.97 millimeter anti-materiel sniper round?! That was close.It would have hit you square in the head if you were just a couple of centimeters taller.
 Their sniper is already in position.
 That must be Utaha and Hibiki’s doing! We should get moving while they have Karin pinned down!
 *rumble*
 N-No, an explosion. You don’t think…?!
 Probably? It’s so dark, though. Watch your step, Sensei.
 Just through here should be…
 Huh?!
 A-Asuna? How’d you know we’d be here?!
 Geez. You didn’t even try to figure it out with reasoning.
 Huh? Begin what?
 Dang, she’s so strong.
 So this is what C&C agents are capable of…
 Sis, I can’t keep going. Let’s run for now!
 Eek!
 Karin? No way. D-Did she beat Utaha…?
 [Millennium Institute 3 Rooftop]
 We can see that!
 *gasp*
 Ugh!
 …No.
 Not yet.
 [Millennium - Veritas]
 (Fifteen minutes earlier…)
 Trap Akane and Asuna. Isolate Karin. Take on the student Council’s security robots. After all that is the easy part, getting into the storage room.
 Trap Akane and Asuna. Isolate Karin. Take on the Student Council’s security robots. After all that is the easy part, getting into the storage room.
 But, if any of that falls through…
 …
 …But what if it wasn’t ALL of us?
 To win, some of us have to lose.
 And then…
 I’m talking about turning the bug of the plan failing…into a feature.
 B-But the Millennium Prize will be over in a week!
 S-Sis!
 I-It’s Akane and the combat robots!
 Sis!
 Sis! Get on the Ground!
 Aris?!
 Aris…
 Right!
 I-I’m fine. So is Sensei
 Broken glass all over… Drawers upended…
 There was probably an explosion from the battle that did this. Karin’s doing, perhaps?
 Here it is! Key item obtained!
 Pause.
 I’ve got a message from Hare.
 (RUN OR HIDE! JUST DON’T—*bzzzzt*)
 It’s weird for Hare to be freaking out. Maybe there’s a rat in the veritas club room or something?
 Wha…?
 Hide!
 …
 H-Hurry! We’ve gotta move!
 …
 (B-But why?! What in the world is she doing here?!)
 (Eek!)
 (We’re so dead…)
 (Y-Yuzu?!)
 That was amazing, Yuzu-chan! You saved us!
 R-Right! Our mission isn’t over yet!
 Right!
 …
 Sorry, Aris… I don’t feel like talking right now…
 …
 It’s really here… the G.BIBLE!
 She means they found it AFTER they unlocked it. Sis, how did you even pass the entrance exams…?
 Hmm…
 I wonder what could the key be…?
 <Identity checkL Are you AL-1S?>
 Good work, Maki!
 …make the best game ever.
 I don’t even want to think about it. But at least Sensei said Schale will help us if it comes to that.
 This is so cool…
 <I will now reveal the one and only secret to making games.>
 Y-You think so?
 <LOVE VIDEO GAMES.>
 I-is it broken or something?
 S-Seriously?!
 <Sorry!>
 <just LOVE VIDEO GAMES!>
 The file isn’t corrupt and hasn’t been modified… The meta data, file size, and data of the most recent copy are an exact match.
 I…think we’ve been had… Sis?
 I’m sorry , Aris. This is just how reality is. This is the true ending…
 *sigh*
 I’m sorry, Aris. We… We just can’t do it without the G.BIBLE. we’re just hopeless failures now.
 Huh?
 Oh, Yuzu. When did you get out of the cabinet?
 Huh?
 I’m a huge fan of your work!
 …
 Yuzu…
 Sis!
 Let’s do it!
 <<To be continued>>
 Episode 19 | Double O
 [Millennium Game Development Department]
 Momoi! Are you done yet?
 We only have two minutes left! There’s no time to spare!
 Please, please please…
 Now all we have to do is wait for the announcement in four days.
 Why would we do that?
 B-But what if they say it’s horrible?
 Well, sure, but…
 Huh?
 Yuzu…
 W-Wait!
 Sure…
 A watched pot never boils, Aris. The real reviews won’t come until later.
 Ah.
 My heart is pounding.
 Oh it’s our first comment!
 Y-You can’t do that!
 Uh… I feel like they’re acting like our game is some kind of ticking time bomb.
 Oh. Someone posted it on a social media aggregate site.
 No! This shell is a 13.97 Millimeter round! It belongs to Karin!
 *BOOM BOOM*
 Momoi…
 I can’t believe iI felt bad for them before!
 Sensei!
 Right!
 Well, we already submitted the game to the Millennium Prize.
 All we have to do is keep running away until they announce the results!
 Huh?!
 *ratta-tat-tat*
 Ahhh!
 Yeah, I've never seen anything like it.
 A-Aris! You can’t say that!
 Th-That’s not really what I meant…
 D-Did she just swing that railgun like a bat!
 Aris! *cough* The smoke!
 Hurry, Sensei!
 *scurries*
 What is wrong with you? Can’t you tell Aris is scared out of her mind?!
 You okay, Aris?
 She seems to be feeling better.
 Aris! Get out of the cabinet! What have you been teaching her, Yuzu?
 Well, that’s good news and all, but…
 We have to pack our bags.
 Which Momoi and I can do, but Yuzu and Aris…
 Looks like everything worked out for Kotori.
 But more entrants means more competition, right…?
 They haven’t called our name…
 I can’t bear to watch anymore!
 *gasp*
 I think I’m going to lose my mind.
 Please don’t shoot it at the awards ceremony!
 Agh! Why’d you shoot the TV?!
 It’s all right, yuzu. We can still…
 but…what about Yuzu and Aris?
 Huh?
 Aris…
 I-I’m sorry.
 …?!
 I’m so sorry, Aris!
 I’m going to visit you at Schale every day! Seriously! Every day!
 We’ll always be linked by the game we made together.
 I can share too!
 You couldn’t wait even a minute to evict us?!
 Wha…?
 It has some, um, bullet holes in it.
 What’s happening…?
 W-Wow…
 I…can’t believe…
 D-Doesn’t that mean they don’t like it?!
 huh? What do you mean, yuzu?
 …!
 That means…!
 Ahhhhh!
 We did it, Aris! We get a budget and get to keep our club room!
 Aris!
