 Someone else has been here. The intel was credible.
 Search the perimeter! Make sure not to be seen!
 Where is the spy we were supposed to make contact with?! We need an update!
 What?!
 Azusa standing in smoke
 Wh-What's happening?! The spy betrayed us?!
 Gunfire and explosions
 ...?!
 Wh-Why?! Why would you do something like this?!
 Huh?!
 …
 No, she's bluffing. According to the intel we received, theJustice Task Force won't be going anywhere.
 It's psychological warfare. She wants us to retreat. Chase after her!
 This must be where Shirasu Azusa has built her stronghold.
 She's left only one entrance—a likely trap. Destroy the barricade and enter through the other!
 Yes. I was just informed by Squad that reinforcements are on their way.
 We can no longer consider this an assassination mission. We're at war with Trinity. We must retrieve the target!
 Prepare yourselves!
 Black screen and explosions
 Arius troops march in
 Charge!
 Don't falter! If we can just make it inside, we'll easily outnumber her!
 Explosion
 Your insubordination ends here, Shirasu Azusa.
 You're trapped. Now tell me where the target is.
 We have reinforcements on the way. You'll be surrounded. There's no escape.
 More than you can handle!
 Unrequired. On another mission.
 Where do you think you're going?! There's nothing but a gym there. I told you: Escape is impossible!
 Her traps have been disarmed! Chase after her!
 The Make-Up Work Club members group up
 NowI see. Setting up an ambush, were you?
 And this is your choice of battlefield?
 How long can you hold out with just four of you? This will be your tomb!
 …!
 Gahhhhhh!
 Arius commander fucking dies
