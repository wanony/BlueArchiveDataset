 Whoa! Shiroko kidnapped someone!
 I'm shocked. We haven't had a visitor in ages.
 Wow! That means you got the letter Ayane wrote! ☆
 Was that gunfire?!
 Okay! Let's sortie, everyone! ☆
 Everyone leaves
 Wow! We won! ☆
 Someone got yelled at!
 Hello,Sensei!
 We're the only club in the school where every single student is a member! I mean, we're the only five students at this school, but still…
 At least we don't have to worry about the Helmet Gang anymore! It pays to have adults in high places! ☆
 I'm all for it. The last thing they're expecting is for us to strike now.
 Okay! Let's go!
 We finally took down the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang. It should be smooth sailing from here.
 I'll go talk to her.
 Nonomi leaves
 Serika, where are you?
 <<To be Continued>>
 05 - A Day in the Life of Serika
 Sensei and the Foreclosure Task Force trail Serika to her part-time job at a ramen shop. They end up sharing a nice meal with her, but Serika is still quite sullen. On her way back from work, Serika is kidnapped by the Helmet Gang.
 [Abydos Residential Area, 45th Block District]
 <I spotted a familiar face while walking through the neighborhood near Abydos.>
 Hello! Table for five! ☆
 Okay! Over here, Sensei! Sit next to me!
 It's a bit tight, but you're okay, right?
 /
 Huh? Are you uncomfortable? Would you rather sit on my lap?
 /
 Haha! I'm just joking, Serika. ☆
 /
 Haha. Okay, okay.
 /
 N/A
 Your uniform is adorable, Serika! ☆
 Now I get why you were running off from time to time. I guess it was because you were working. ☆
 I'll have the chashu ramen, please!
 It's not like I mind. I'm still way under my card's credit limit. ☆
 … (smile)
 (Here, Sensei. Just pay with this card.)
 (Huh? Are you sure you don't want to? But...)
 <I ended up paying for everyone's meals.>
 Thank you for treating us.
 What about her phone?
 Nothing like this has ever happened before. She always gets home safely…
 That's one of the neighborhoods that's become more desolate, isn't it?
 Probably! We have to go save her!
 Don't cry, Serika! We're here now, and we promise to dry those tear-soaked cheeks of yours!
 Serika!
 Uh-huh. Tracking down Serika's location was a piece of cake thanks to you, Sensei. You're always so reliable! ☆
 I bet we can find out who those hooligans answer to if we analyze the distribution channels for these parts!
 Okay! ☆
 That's right! It's like we're a proper task force now! ☆
 Serika is so gullible it's cute! ☆
 There, there, Serika. It's okay. Why don't I treat you to lunch?
 Wowie! Check it out! Don't I look like a luchador?
 Hey, excuse me! Me next!
 You got it! I have the perfect thing, and I promise it isn't illegal or a pyramid scheme. This one is definitely gonna work!
 Two words pop idols! Schoolgirl pop idols, to be exact!
 You heard me! It happens all the time in anime. Nothing helps revitalize a school like becoming a pop superstar! If we all break into the industry together as pop idols…
 What...? You don't like that idea either?
 But I even came up with a pose…
 *poses*
 Christina of the Swimsuit Gang! ♧
 Aww. But I worked on it all night…
 Pop idol stardom, here we come! ☆
 Yay! That sounds like so much fun! ☆
 Ahhh! Ayane is in berserk mode! Everyone take cover!
 That's it. Hush now. There's a good girl. ☆
 *squeezes in* I know, right? Isn't it the best?
 Yep! The ramen here is the best around. People come from all over just to get a taste of it.
 Girls sharing a bowl of ramen together like this. It's a little nostalgic, isn't it?
 Good luck with your business!
 Wait. Aren't those the girls we met at the ramen shop?
 What kind of job is that for girls your age?! Shouldn't you be working normal part-time jobs?
 Hang on...! Oh, well. They're gone.
 …
 Do you ever wonder why they only accept cash payments? Why go through all the trouble to constantly pay for armored trucks?
 She's an executive at her age? That's so cool! ☆
 So they're in violation of school regulations... Strange. They didn't strike me as all that bad or malicious.
 Isn't that place supposed to be really dangerous?
 There's our link!
 Whoa! There's a ton of people here!
 Bad guys have to be punished! ☆
 A biochemical agent?
 Wow! I love Momo Friends too! Peroro is so cute! ☆ I'm a fan of Mr. Nicholai, personally.
 I can't believe how organized it all is.
 Wow! That's a brilliant idea! ☆
 It feels like we've been walking for hours…
 Look over there! They're selling taiyaki!
 Should we grab some snacks and take a break? I'm buying!
 No, that's okay. I really want some, so I insist.
 Sorry you're not here, Ayane. We'll bring some back for you.
 Goodness. So the bank is just as complicit as anyone else.
 Market Guards?
 Hey. Look over there.
 <*click* *clank* *click*>
 It's entering the Stygian Bank?
 <*screech*>
 Hey. Wasn't that...?
 Well, technically, we weren't the ones who originally owed the debt.
 Come to think of it, they were very adamant about cash only. Do you think it's because...?
 …
 Oh, now I get it! We're going to use THAT plan, aren't we?
 Yippee! Time to teach that evil bank a lesson! ☆
 But I don't want you to feel left out.
 This is the best we can do last-minute. Take this, Hifumi! ☆
 I even wrote you a number, Hifumi. You‘re No.5. ☆
 Yay! Let's go! ☆
 Or else! ☆
 That's right—you're the leader! The boss! And as for myself…
 I'm Christina of the Masked Swimsuit Gang! ♧
 …
 All righty, then. Adios! ☆
 Everything's been planned and accounted for, so no worries! ☆
 I agree with Serika. This would've just funded more crime anyway. Whatever we do with it, we'll put it to far better use.
 Well, I did offer that as a solution, but Hoshino was against it…
 I mean, I understand. If we use illegitimate means to pay off Abydos' debt, we'll just be
 paying it off in exchange for being beholden to something else…
 Now that doesn't leave us with much of a choice, does it? I'll just get rid of this bag somewhere discreet.
 Oh, nowI get it! We'd be happy to tell you!
 We are...the Masked Swimsuit Gang!
 That's right! We're pop idol superstars by day, and swashbuckling vigilantes of justice who fight bad guys by night!
 I'm Christina! ♧
 All righty, then. Adios! ☆
 Uh-oh. I think I forgot to pick up the cash bag.
 I hope so too! I hope it goes to someone who could really use the money.
 …!
 So, that means…
 But why would they do that? They won't be paid if the school goes bankrupt. It doesn't make any sense…
 Same here. Sorry for bringing you into this mess, Hifumi.
 Aren't you being too cynical about this, Hoshino? What if they just really wanted to help?
 How does "fearless leader of the Masked Swimsuit Gang" sound?
 You're here early. Good to see you.
 There's room for you too, Sensei! Make yourself comfortable! ☆
 No one said you could call dibs, Hoshino…
 (Why don‘t you come back later when no one else is around, Sensei?)
 It's the first breather we've had in a while... So I guess everyone is trying check some stuff off their lists.
 Shiroko is probably working out and Ayane is most likely studying at the library.
 Maybe you'd like to do something productive for a change, Hoshino? Like a part-time job or going to the gym?
 But we're practically the same age.
 Huh? Hey, where are you going?
 Hoshino... I bet she's gonna go take another nap.
 I guess that's okay. Ayane will make sure the meeting runs smoothly anyway.
 Haha... Still, Hoshino's changed a lot since I first met her.
 Hmm? What was she like before?
 Well, she might come across as a lazy sleepyhead now, but there was never a moment when Hoshino didn't seem frazzled back then.
 What was she frazzled by? I dunno... Everything?
 I don't know all the details, but there used to be another student around here before…
 Apparently, she was the last student council president Abydos had. From what I heard, she wasn't very reliable or trustworthy. Hoshino had to do everything herself after she disappeared.
 That was back when Hoshino was just a first-year. Anyway, like I said, I don't know all the details.
 But now we have you, Sensei. And she seems to have no trouble hanging out with students from other academies too…
 She never would have done something like that before. I guess you could say she's finally softened up a bit.
 And I think it's all thanks to you, Sensei! ☆
 She's right! Now's not the time! Let's head over right away!
 …
 Get ready to get owned!
 Mortars...?
 Geez…
 Dealing with the Prefect Team and some small-time crooks like Problem Solver couldn't be any more different. They're the official armed forces of their academy.
 This might escalate into a political conflict if we're not careful…
 Ayane, is there still no word from Hoshino?
 So...what should we do here?
 B-But we can't fight them head on...can we?
 Shiroko?!
 …
 …
 And if holding someone at gunpoint is your idea of having a conversation, that’s pretty reprehensible, if you ask me.
 Whoa…
 …
 Yeah, AND we can use this chance to find out who they’re working for. We’re not done with them yet.
 Sensei?!
 …
 All of us will protect Sensei together! Got it?
 I guess the senior administrator really was acting on her own…
 …?!
 …
 Our position has not changed.
 Well, not all of them…
 Sh-She bowed?!
 !
 I don’t know… Why was the head prefect here?
 Right. So much happened today… We shouldn’t push ourselves to do any more. We need to rest.
 Okay.
 Oh, Sensei?
 You’re certainly here early! ☆ We still have a lot of time left before the meeting begins.
 Sure am! I got here early to do some cleaning. I just couldn’t sit still…
 How’s the master doing?
 Oh, I’m glad.
 I thought it would be too overwhelming for him if we all went to the hospital together, so it didn’t go with the others.
 I’ll have to go with Shiroko and Hoshino later.
 But when you say his health seems fine…
 Do you mean that there’s another problem?
 Ahaha… Call it a hunch.
 You left with Serika and Ayane but came back alone, so I thought maybe something had happened…
 Okay, then you can tell me once we’re all together. If it’s important, then we should all know about it.
 …
 A lot has changed since you came here…
 We got our very first advisor, and we were able to fight off the gangs that had been harassing us…
 We secured the supplies we needed, and we’ve overcome so many problems…
 …But it seems like now we have more problems to face than ever.
 The Helmer Gang… Problem Solver… The Prefect Team… The Kaiser Corporation…
 I wonder what else lies ahead…
 …
 Do you think…the Foreclosure Task Force will be able to keep moving forward?
 Yup, yup! If you say so, then it must be true.
 Oh, Shiroko, are you here to wait with us?
 Hoshino? She’s already here. She’s probably taking a nap somewhere around the school again…
 Yup, yup! Sensei told me that Master’s health is fine!
 But it seems like there’s something else going on, so we should all meet up to discuss it.
 Somehow, Shiroko seems…
 R-Right? That’s the vibe I got too…
 She seemed kind of nervous for some reason…
 Hmm, I hope I’m just imagining it…
 Yeah, okay!
 *fade to black*
 *bang*
 (It actually sounds like someone hitting something)
 *crash*
 (It actually sounds like someone or something falling to the floor)
 …?!
 That sounded like…
 Hoshino! Shiroko! What’s going on?!
 What the hell is going on?
 Yeah, no can do! ☆
 There are no secrets in the Foreclosure Task Force. You know that we’re all on the same team, right?
 So, if you don’t explain what’s going on…
 …you’ll be punished.
 …
 …Yes. I think she’s hiding something.
 …
 It’s okay, though. Everyone has at least one secret they hold close…
 We should go too, Sensei. We can’t keep everyone waiting.
 *fade to black*
 Foreclosure Task Force Room
 …
 Huh? You mean this document confirms who owns the land?
 Everyone knows that Abydos’ land belongs to the school, so what’s the point of showing us this?
 The current owner is…
 …What?!
 Kaiser Construction? You mean the Kaiser Corporation?!
 The Abydos district belongs to Kaiser?!
 N-No way… Not the ramen shop…
 B-But, how is this possible? How could the land in the academy district have been traded away?
 Who would do such a thing?
 But…the Abydos Student Council has been gone for two years…
 This is huge, and we had no idea it had ever happened…
 Oh, right! You used to be part of the Abydos Student Council, didn’t you?
 Why do you think the former Student Council sold the land to Kaiser?
 The debt…
 So they kept selling land…
 That means…
 Then, the reason they lent that money to Abydos in the first place…was so they could take the land.
 …
 But…why do they want the land?
 The Abydos district is nothing but wilderness and sand-blasted ruins…
 Up to something?
 (Nods in motherly approval)
 I’ve been to the sandy city streets, but never out this far before…
 A factory? I don’t think it’s an oil rig… What the heck is it?
 What were these people? And what are they doing here?
 But PMC means…
 It stands for Private Military Company…
 There were rumors about a company recruiting dropouts, expelled students, and troublemakers into a private army… Could this be…
 *REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE* (Siren sounds)
 A-An alarm?!
 Do you hear…helicopters?
 …
 *Car braking sounds*
 …
 …Who are you?
 Abydos’ creditor…
 …!
 Th-That may be true, but…! There’s no way we can do that!
 I think they’re excavating something! But what…?
 Then why go through the trouble of seizing the land?
 N-No! If you go off again…
 Huh?! N-Not you too!
 …
 We have to stop them! It doesn’t matter what their intentions are. We can’t let them just assault Abydos.
 …
 What is the meaning of this? A corporation attacking a city? You have no right—regardless of how much of it you own!
 …
 But that would mean all the hard work we’ve done…
 But…
 You can’t be serious, Ayane.
 …
 *booooooom*
 Aru’s pep talk was true too. That was just what we needed. We can’t be wasting our time here.
 …
 Hey! There you are.
 That’s right! She went back on her word and needs to be taught a lesson! A super scary lesson!
 I’ll do it too! You don’t have to join, Serika. More for the rest of us.
 They did help us earlier, but they took off after that. I don’t know if we can ask them for another favor.
 Yep! We’ve got lots of supplies and lots of snacks.
 Yup, there’s not a scratch on me!
 *Soldiers appear at the distance*
 Well good to see you, Faust! It’s been a while. And I think your nickname is really cute! ☆
 Faust	I guess it is. I did come up with it…
 The Tea Party gave me the nod to lend some fire support.
 Completely off the record with Trinity, by the way! Though the artillery unit knows what’s happening too…
 J-Just be thankful for what you’re getting, okay? I can’t promise I’ll be much help.
 Absolutely! Thanks for the support, Faust!
 Faust	Y-You’re welcome. Anyway, good luck, everyone!
 What is this place?
 And where is Hoshino?!
 That’s pretty good timing on your part. Could this mean that you actually…?
 …!
 Yup! We’ll be sure to treat you!
 Let’s move!
 *Kaiser director spawns from the sands*
 Please step aside or else…!
 You said it! We’re not going to let someone like you have their way!
 Hey, Serika beat me to it! After she got all embarrassed earlier and said she wasn’t gonna say it!
 That’s right! Welcome back!
 I have a better idea! Why don’t we use this as an opportunity to go on a well-earned vacation?
 It’s perfect for a gang that’s an idol group by day and fights villains by night! ♣️
 Bingo. Just ask the higher-ups at Kaiser Corporation about what Faust did to them! ♣️
 *gasp*! Faust unmasked! Did we dote on her too much?
 Hoshino also unmasks.
 I don’t see the problem! Doesn’t it warm your heart to see everyone getting along? ⭐
