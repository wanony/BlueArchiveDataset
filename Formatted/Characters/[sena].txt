 This way, Sensei! Take my hand!
 Listen closely, Sensei. You’ve been shot.
 Count yourself lucky that none of your vitals were hit, but you’ll bleed out if we don’t treat you.
 I’m going to start administering first aid. Don’t be afraid to cry out of it hurts.
 I won’t let you die. This is what the Medical Emergency Club is trained for.
 I’ve come to transport someone who’s been critically injured. Please clear the way. This is an emergency.
 …
 Ahem. I should be thanking you, Remedial Knights.
 No. It's Schale’s [Name] Sensei.
 Correct. Sensei suffered a gunshot wound.
 The 2 Knights leave a few dots…
 The lake? The chair is a lucky woman.
 We’ll take care of the transportation. Continue your rescue efforts. Place any more you find into intensive care units.
 What of the Prefect Team?
 …
 The head prefect supported the Eden Treaty more than any of us…
 Nothing. Please continue as you were.
 …
 A Storm is coming. Hurry.
 Scene switch to Trinity.
 You’re looking well, Sensei.
 I’m glad the treatment worked out in the end. It was my first time caring for an adult.
 You shouldn’t be out of bed yet, Chinatsu. Go lie down. Don’t make me pull the seniority card.
 The door is always open for you to return to the Medical Emergency Club. I’ll see to it that you only work with the highest quality cadavers. Er, patients, I mean to say.
 I'm here. Where are the bodies?
 Pardon me. I mean to say "wounded". I confuse the two sometimes.
 According to this, I'm here for three freshly wounded and one hostage.
 You don't seem to be from the Justice Task Force. Just who are you?
 You're acquainted, Head Prefect?
 Sena. Himuro Sena, Medical Emergency Club president. It's nice to meet you, Sensei.
 If you ever have bodies—I mean, wounded—that need transporting, please let me know. We charge a flat rate.
 I'm only interested in the deceased. I'll leave you to dirty your hands with politics.
 My mistake...but the same goes for you, Head Prefect.
 Transfer complete. Ready to depart.
 We're still waiting, Head Prefect. Have you said what you needed to?
