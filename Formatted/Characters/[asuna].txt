 Howdy, Game Development Department! And… Uhhh, what was your name again? “Sensy”?
 Oh, right! It’s Sensei!
 I’ve been waiting here the whole time!
 I dunno!
 Call it a hunch! I had a feeling that if I waited here, I’d meet up with Sensei sooner or later. And you guys too!
 Call it a woman’s intuition.
 Anyway, shall we begin?
 Our fight of course, silly! There’s nothing better to do than a good fight!
 Oh, right. We should make formal introductions first.
 C&C’s callsign Zero-One, Asuna, reporting for duty!
 Ready or not, here I come!
 Heh heh.
 (Hmm. They aren’t that strong on their own, but I have to give them some credit)
 (It’s their teamwork. They move in sync like one person with two bodies. Even most veterans aren’t capable of that.)
 So, this is the advantage of being twins, is it?
 How marvelous.
 Trying to retreat? I don’t think so!
 *bang*
 I’m not sure, but I’ve got a feeling that we’re winning. And not only that…
 …something tells me you girls are in trouble.
 I can’t hear when you’re whispering, but It doesn’t really matter.
 You don’t seem as desperate as you were before. Not giving up just yet?
 huh?
 Agh!
 Definitely not! Whoa! Wh-What was that?! Ahaha! I’m hit! And it hurts like hell. I can’t move a single muscle!
 Ahaha! It hurts so bad, but I’m having so much fun! This is the best!
 …
 Whoa!
 I saw Aris get out, and she was a mess. Our little Neru might be a pancake by now…
 Whoa, That’s our president! A little rubble’s got nothing on her!
 Neru?
 You’re worried about Sensei aren’t you?
 Sounds good!
