 Sorry for the short delay...Aru, was it?
 We've had some internal issues. Our apologies.
 However, I'm not quite sure if you're in the position to make any demands, Miss Aru.
 As someone in need of assistance from our bank, waiting is the least you can do. And not to mention, it's frowned upon to sleep on communal seating.
 *snaps* Guard. Wake up those bums...I mean, customers…
 Scene change
 *flip* Now, let's see here. Name...Rikuhachima Aru. Affiliation: second-year at Gehenna Academy.
 And look at this. You only have four people under you, but each have special titles… Chief of staff, section chief, and entry-level employee? That's quite a reach. Are you playing make-believe at running a company?
 Would you care to explain this extravagant office lease you're paying? You should know better than to extend yourself beyond your means.
 …
 My, my, Aru. This doesn't look like it's going well for you at all.
 My strong recommendation is that you secure legitimate employment at once. Might I suggest looking into the early-morning day-laborer market?
 Aru, are you listening?!
 I said, your loan application has been denied. Now, run along.
 What's going on? A power outage?!
 Did someone trip a breaker? All of the computers are dead!
 <*pop* *pop* *pop* *tat*>
 *WEE WOO* *WEE WOO* Alert! Alert!
 *gasp*
 O-Of course! Cash, bonds, gold, whatever you want! You got it!
 H-Here they are! All neatly organized, so please don't hurt me!
 D-Don't let them get away! Seal off the roads! Contact the Market Guards!
 They must be found at once!
