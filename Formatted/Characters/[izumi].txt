 The tuna keeps flapping around! It's hitting me with its fins!
 Can't we just eat it already?! It's hard enough to hold on to it but now we have those girls in black sailor uniforms chasing us!
 .
 Noooooo! The tuna!
 W-Wait! Don't just leave me here!
 Izumi trips and falls
 *sob* I swear, I'll get all three of you back for this if it's the last thing I do!
 Izumi gets up and whisks away
 *sob* Wh-Where am I?! Where am I supposed to go?!
 Izumi runs away
 Ahhh! The Prefect Team is still chasing us!
 That Trinity girl isn't half bad on a bike!
