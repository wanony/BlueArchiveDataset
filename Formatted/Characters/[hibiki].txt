 Uh, hi. I’m Hibiki, and, um, I’m a first year here… Let’s find you something special
 How about this?
 That’s, uh, pretty prolific of you.
 Still, it seems like you’re new to guns.
 In which case, a pistol is ideal. It has a light plastic frame, and there isn’t much recoil…
 It’s a good starter gun, but there’s something even better about it.
 This model has a never-before-seen feature that–until recently–has never existed in the history of our school.
 The new feature that will rock the world of firearms is…
 Bluetooth.
 The one and only pistol that allows wireless music playback and file sharing via Bluetooth.
 It also functions as a digital car key, and can be used to tag into IC panels on public transit services.
 And to top it all off, if you enable the NFC feature, you can use it to make payments at convenience stores.
 Oh, there she is.
 She’s looking at…
 *nod nod*
 By the way, the official name of this passion project is…
 …Huh?
 Aris O great formers of steel. Bequeath unto me the might of the dragon’s breath
 …I have my reasons.
 B-Be careful. don’t hurt yourself… We really should have the crane over here to–
 No…way…
 W-Wait!
 Can do.
 On the plus side, we’re going to be able to collect a lot of good data from, uh, real combat scenarios.
 …Okay.
 I still can’t believe you can even lift the gun…
 Anyway, uh, come here, Aris. I can give you some operating instructions and reinforce the grip some more.
 Because that sounds fun.
 Well, there is a weakness. We should know–we put it there.
 For starters, the system is vulnerable to external power failures. When power is lost, it automatically connects to the external network, opening a short window for the system to be hacked.
 Using our nano-EMP, we can send Millenium back to the Stone Age for about six seconds.
