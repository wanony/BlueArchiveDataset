 A yen saved is a yen earned. I knew we'd find one.
 That's "Boss" to you. You should know better than to not refer to me by my title, Chief of Staff Mutsuki.
 …
 Heh. Would you expect me to do anything less? Be grateful there was enough left for a bowl of ramen.
 Heh heh heh…
 They could be…
 Who are you calling a chicken?! I'm just being careful and covering our bases!
 Shut up! I'll take you all out for sukiyaki once we finish this job and get paid. So you'd better go all out!
 Heh heh. Problem Solver is an industry titan at this point. We deserve only the best, wouldn't you agree?
 I told you to call me Boss!
 I didn't see this coming, but it'd be rude of us to send it back.
 …!
 I can see why. I've been to my fair share of shops, and ramen this good is hard to find.
 Haha! I never expected to run into fellow connoisseurs here. Isn't life wonderfully unpredictable sometimes?
 Same to you guys! Good luck with revitalizing your school. I'll be cheering you on!
 Bye-bye!
 Scene change
 Heh... What great kids, yeah?
 Huh? No. Why?
 Wh-What?! They were?!
 Back to scene
 Y-You're serious... They're the ones from Abydos? Ugh. Ah… Why is fate such a cruel mistress?
 Do we gotta...? Do we have to wipe them out this second?
 I-I know that, but…
 I gotta pull myself together! What kind of executive would I be ifI can't do a simple job like this?
 Let's do it! Round up the muscle!
 …
 Just taking care of business. I trust you're all prepared?
 We can leave the fine print for later. Let's get going! Time to attack Abydos!
 U-Urgh…
 It's not a part-time job! This is a real, respectable business! With titles and everything!
 And I'm the boss!
 Mutsuki in scene
 She's the chief of staff.
 Kayoko in scene
 And this here is the department head.
 Haha. Good luck. We don't spill trade secrets.
 Get 'em, girls!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 Thanks to the work of the Foreclosure Task Force, Aru and Problem Solver are forced to withdraw.
 <*ding* *ding* *ding* *dong* *ding* *ding* *ding* *dong*>
 Wh-What?! W-Wait a second!
 Part-Timer A and B leave
 Hey! What the heck is this?! Don'tjust leave!
 Ughhh...
 Y-You haven't seen the last of us, Abydos!
 Shut up! Everyone, run... I mean, retreat!
 Problem Solver whisks away
 …
 Tch.
 *click*
 Problem Solver 68…
 Uh, what? But that was the real op—
 I mean, uh, the real operation will be underway soon. That is to say, it will be in a week. Yup…
 Hahaha. That's right. You have nothing to worry about.
 <*clang*>
 *exhale*
 Truth be told, I don't know a lot about the client, butI know they're not to be messed with. We don't want to disappoint them…
 B-Because a proper business needs a proper workplace! B-Because a proper business needs a proper workplace!
 Shut up! Just shut your mouths! All of you!
 …
 We'll get a loan.
 Nuh-uh! My account just been frozen because of a bounty!
 Those jerks... I can't believe they'd stoop so low.
 Shut up! We'll figure it out somehow!
 Stupid Abydos twits. I said they hadn't seen the last of us, didn't I?!
 We're just getting started!
 Aru whisks away
 You call that a short delay?! I've been waiting here for six hours!
 What kind of loan interview is this?! I've been here the whole day, and there wasn't even anyone in front of us!
 Look at my associates over there! We've been waiting for so long that they've passed out on the couch!
 U-Ugh…
 …
 N-No! We're completely legitimate! Wejust haven't received payment on some of our commissions yet!
 If you want to earn commissions, you have to keep up appearances…
 Y-You've gotta spend money to make money...?
 Th-This can't be happening!
 Wh-What was that?!
 Fade to black
 *shudder*
 (Why you little... I oughta smash everything and rob this bank right now!)
 (I need to stay cool. Even ifI rob this bank, escaping from the Black Market is another
 story. Consider all those Market Guards on patrol everywhere...)
 (But is it really? Maybe those guys aren't actually that big of a deal. Who's to say the four
 of us won't be able to blast our way out of here and take 'em down?)
 (On second thought...I don't have the guts to make the entire Black Market my enemy.)
 (This is so pathetic. I wanted to become the greatest outlaw in all of Kivotos, but look at
 me now...)
 (This loan, my business... Everything I touch turns into a huge mess.)
 (This isn't want I wanted at all... I wanted to be a hard-boiled outlaw. A true, free spirit not bound to anything—not even fear.)
 (It's all I ever wanted.)
 O-Of course I am! So...could you repeat that?
 Wait, what?! H-Hold on a second!
 Black screen
 <*pow*>
 Gunfire?!
 Gunfire
 B-Bank robbers?!
 …
 (They're really robbing a Black Market bank! That's sooooo cool!)
 (How are they gonna pull off the getaway? And more importantly, how do they have the GUTS to do this kind of stuff?!)
 (Look at that cool, calm composure. They're pros. It's like they were born to do this. They pulled this off in five minutes flat!)
 (I-It's magnificent! So badass! Now these guys are real outlaws! I'm gonna start tearing up.)
 Scene change
 *pant* *pant* H-Hold up a second!
 Hold on a second! I'm not here to pick a fight.
 So, um... I just wanted to say…
 Iwatched you hit that bank. I can't believe you robbed a Black Market bank and got away
 with it in five minutes flat! Outlaws like you guys come only once in a generation.
 To be honest, it left a huge impression on me. That kind of bravado is a rarity these days. Let's just say I was inspired.
 I-I'm gonna keep working hard, and someday, I'm gonna become an outlaw just like you! A truly free spirit unrestricted by any rules or laws!
 S-So please...! At least tell me your name!
 Like, what's the name of your group? Or is it a faction, or a club? It doesn't have to be your real names...but I want to know who it is I'm looking up to!
 You said..."the Masked Swimsuit Gang"?!
 That name is so...so...BADASS! I love it!
 Wow! You have a gimmick and everything?!
 H-Holy smokes!
 Scene change
 …
 The path of chaos it is! I'm gonna burn that motto into the depths of my soul!
 What? You don't think...the Masked Swimsuit Gang left this here as a gift for me, do you?
 …!
 Huh?!
 Whaaat?!
 The Masked Swimsuit Gang was actually those girls from Abydos?!
 *yawn* Good morning…
 N-No. I slept...technically speaking.
 Tch…
 No upfront payments—company policy. You know that.
 Exactly. We get paid only when the job is done. That's how it has to be. And I never compromise.
 Since always! We're hard-boiled outlaws untethered to rules or laws! That's always been the guiding vision for Problem Solver 68!
 Contracts are no different. There's always a chance it might turn into a trap. We don't want to get caught doing something we don't want to do.
 And that's why we only accept payment once the job is done.
 What?!
 Wh-Who said anything about it being too much pressure?! I'm just...a little…
 …
 No. Going back is out of the question.
 But I wish it wasn't…
 …?!
 We're not…
 We're not their friends!
 <*slam*>
 You know what my problem is? I've figured it out. It's this shop! That's what my problem is!
 We're here to work, right? Dangerous, hard-boiled, rough-and-tumble work! Like outlaws!
 But what's this place? A little shop that feeds you when you get hungry! It's cushy, warm, and the people here are nothing but nice to you! They even have the nerve to start polite conversation!
 We're going to be friends and regulars if we keep coming here like this!
 It's ruining everything! How am I ever going to be a real, true-blue villain ifI keep coming to a heartwarming hole-in-the wall like this?!
 What I need right now is cold-blooded ruthlessness and steely determination! Not this load of sweetness and fluff!
 Huh?
 …
 Wait a sec…
 White screen
 <*BOOM*>
 *cough* *cough* A-Aaauuuggghhh…
 ?
 ?
 (Wh-What's going on?! What the heck just happened?!)
 ME?! What did I do?!
 Er, what? Huh?
 Uh, wha...? O-Oh! A-Ahahaha... Th-That's right! Exactly! We'll do anything as long as we get paid! Yep, that's us!
 …?!
 …
 Y-Yeah, that's right! That's the kind of person I am. You finally getting the picture, you
 Abydos losers?
 It's time for us to settle this! Go ahead and make your move!
 Oh, puh-lease! I'm gonna teach you a lesson about tangling with a true outlaw!
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 During the climax of the battle between Problem Solver and Foreclosure Task Force, the combatants are suddenly shelled from afar. Ayane announces that the cannons were fired by Gehenna Academy's Prefect Team.
 *pant* *pant* You've got to be kidding me!
 Don't they ever give up...?!
 <*kablam*>
 <*KABLAM*>
 <*KABOOM*>
 …
 Heh.
 Heh heh heh…
 Oh, Kayoko. You should know me better by now.
 Run away? After the way they’ve treated us? We never run away from a fight!
 Problem Solver is anything but a pack of third-rate villains!
 I could never forgive myself if I let them get away with such blatant disrespect!
 (Screen returns to normal)
 Ah… Ahahahahaha!
 Naturally! Who do you think I am? Our victory is assured.
 Trust is met with trust! That’s the Problem Solver way!
 And for the record, we didn’t blow up the ramen shop by mistake!
 Th-That was totally on purpose…got it?!
 It was an act of high-level psychological warfare that only a cold-hearted outlaw like me can use…
 Th-This is nothing! We can keep fighting!
 What?! You mean Hina is coming here?! W-We have ro tun, now!
 *sigh*
 *sigh*
 You can’t throw that away! We have to take it with us!
 B-But, it’ll be worth about 100 million yen in ten years or so…
 *sigh*
 Th-Those backstabbers! How could they target those who fought alongside them? They’re cowards, that’s what they are!
 Sh-Shut up! Shut up!
 I know!
 …
 I know I’m not…a hard-boiled outlaw…
 (Crash sound)
 I-I said shut up!
 *Transition to somewhere else*
 Hmm…
 Y-You?!
 Wh-What are you doing here? You’re on Abydos’s side!
 We’re not leaving! We’re moving on so we can get more commissions! So let’s go already!
 …
 A-Ahahaha! Of course, Sensei! I can see us doing business together.
 Though, we can’t right now since we’re so busy. Maybe some other time.
 O-Of course! I’ll come back for the ramen!
 …
 (Aru gets closer)
 …It was delicious.
 *fade to black*
 (Soon, the truck loading with Problem Solver 68’s worldly possessions passed through the alley.)
 Wasn’t that the Masked Mizugi Gang’s motto?
 What are all of you doing here?!
 There’s no finish line in sight, you can’t find a way to get there, and everything you do is failure after failure.
 No one sees how hard you struggle, and the only things waiting for you are more hardships and rough days ahead…
 (close-up to Aru)
 But who cares?!
 Are you really going to let something like that get in the way of rescuing your friend?!
 You all are even stupider than you look!
 Very well. Let’s show them how real outlaws fight.
 Light it up, Haruka.
 Back us up, Sensei!
 Let’s show the Foreclosure Idiot Force what it means to be hard-boiled!
 Shut up! What makes you think we ever want to work with you?! Sensei treats us way better than you losers ever did!
 …
 …
 *fade to black*
 Hmph.
 Then we’re all in agreement.
 Are all of you ready to follow me to the depths of hell?
 (Wh-What am I talking about?!)
 (I was just gonna go home after I was done with my ramen!)
 (I screwed up and never corrected them! Now I’m stuck here!)
 (What if I ran away…? Wait. No…)
 (Those Abydos morons thanked me for breaking them out of their funk. They probably see me as a better person now.)
 (What should I do? We’ll be fighting a PMC, not market guards. There’s no way this won’t go wrong!)
 (What do I do?! What do I do?!)
 I only wanted to lend a hand from the shadows, but you all looked like you were in a tight spot.
 Heh. It helps that you’re quick on the uptake, Foreclosure Task Force. Isn’t it obvious why we’re here?
 *Close-up to Aru*
 Go. We can take care of things here. You need to save your friend!
 (M-Me and my big mouth!)
 I-I got caught up in the heat of the moment! It’s not too late to back out now!
 Wh-What?!
