 *sigh* Makoto. Please try not to make this conversation any more awkward.
 Schale’s Sensei has been asked to mediate the Eden Treaty’s signing. They’re only here to make a formal greeting.
 What partnership? You’ve only just met. What were you expecting of them?
 What? Already?
 What are you talking about…?
 Coup d’état?
 How long have you been conspiring this? That would mean… you never had intended to sign the Eden Treaty in the first place.
 Makoto… you understand that Arius hates Gehenna even more than they hate Trinity, correct? Why would they ever agree to cooperate with us?
 *sigh* They tricked you, Makoto.
 *BOOM*
 No, I don’t-know-what. In any case, you should be getting more rest.
 Besides, we were out for so long that the conflict has already been resolved. Also, please do something about your hair before you open your mouth again.
 Do you not remember us going down in a ball of flames? It must have been… *sigh* Never mind.
 Scene change to more Infirmary.
 Makoto, this isn't President Tsurugi—this is their vice president, Hasumi. I told you she'd be coming in the documentation I handed you.
 And if you're referring to her bust, then I don't know what good bringing Satsuki here will do.
 …
 No, this is why I tried to inform you that we were expecting Hasumi. Are you even listening to me? You're not, are you?
 Please calm down. And please stop mentioning her bust. You're embarrassing the Pandemonium Society.
 I don't know what you're talking about, but I think it's safe to say that the meeting is a failure. I advise that we secure an escape route.
