 …
 Oh... U-Um…
 Uh... Excuse me. How much is the cheapest thing on your menu?
 Oh, uh, thank you!
 <*door opens*>
 Y-You were right. I guess you really do know everything, Boss…
 S-Sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry that we're broke and we're poor!
 No, really! What's the point of living like this? We're just a waste of air! Lower than dirt! We never should have come in here. Sorry, sorry, sorry…
 I...shouldn't?
 Sukiyaki...?! Wait. What's that?
 W-Wow. I don't know if dirt like me could appreciate it, then. Would I have to sacrifice my life afterward for overindulging?
 Uh, are you sure this is the right order? We don't have the money to pay for something like this…
 W-Wow…
 I-It's so yummy!
 B-But doesn't that mean they're our targets? Sh-Should I go back inside and snuff them out?
 I-I won't let you down, Aru!
 We'll crush them to dust!
 Sh-Should I start looking for some part-timers to use as hired muscle?
 S-Sorry! We're very sorry! We shouldn't have dozed off!
 Scene change
 A-Are they here for us?! Sh-Should I go annihilate all of them?
 Uh, so do we just stay put?
 If you say so…
 Hey, um…
 What should we do with this bag? I think those guys left it behind…
 So...?
 Does this mean we won't have to share ramen next time?
 <Back at Problem Solver 68's office…>
 Black screen
 I'm back.
 I finished planting the bombs at key junctions. Now, all I have to do is press this button, and…
 Of course. Say the word and they'll be blown to smithereens…
 And we each get our own bowl. How luxurious.
 ...?!
 …
 So...you're saying that this shop needs to go, Aru?
 *scooch*
 I'm so glad. Now I can finally be of assistance to you.
 *click*
 *dazed*
 <<To be Continued>>
 19 - You’ll Pay for This!
 Unaware of Aru '5 true feelings, the Foreclosure Task Force blame Aru for the heinous atrocity she accidentally caused. Eventually, Aru ends up confronting the team, pretending to be the villain they believe she is.
 [Destroyed Downtown Abydos]
 <*woosh*>
 *dazed*
 That's right. I'll mow them all down.
 *shifts*
 *sneaking*
 …
 Heh heh…
 Heh heh heh. They're all sitting ducks…
 *smirks* This is our chance.
 Haruka sneaks away
 Fade to black
 No forgiveness... It's unforgivable.
 Unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable… Unforgivable, unforgivable,
 unforgivable, unforgivable…
 <<TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 2>> (Slowly walking away)
 Unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable…
 I will never, ever, ever, ever forgive… Eh?
 (Haruka looks at Sensei)
 …
 (Smiles and proceeds to disappear from the scene)
 (Appears behind Iori out of nowhere)
 Unforgivable…
 Aaarrrggghhh! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable!
 *KA-POW* *POW* *POW* *POW* *POW* *POW*
 (Shooting sounds)
 S-Sorry! Sorry I didn’t come to the rescue sooner…
 It’s all my fault… The plan is ruined! Sh-Should I sacrifice myself as penance?! I’ll do it gladly!
 Aru…
 Yes! And we owe it to Sensei!
 E-Excuse me. Where should I put this?
 That’s true, Aru! If it weren’t for you, I don’t know if I would still be alive today…
 (Purple shines)
 I look up to you more than anyone, Aru!
 Heave-ho!
 That’s it! Everything’s loaded!
 …!
 That’s true. And Sensei did help us when we were fighting the Prefect Team…
 Yes, I agree.
 Heh heh heh. I’m ready when you are, Aru. We still have plenty of bombs left…
 *click*
 *booooooom*
 *booooooom*
 *kabooooooom* (Dust everywhere)
 I-It’s all my fault it was… How can I ever pay for my sins? I don’t deserve to live!
 N-Now I understand, Aru! Stepping into hell itself to protect the ramen we love! That’s what real outlaws would do!
 I-I’ll do my best to become a true outlaw! I’ll wipe them all out!
 I-I’ll follow you to hell and back!
 E-Excuse us!
 G-Give me your orders, Aru! My life is yours!
 E-Excuse me.
 Oh, yes, yes... U-Umm... I forgot something…
 U-um, right. S-So…
 …
 F-Forgive…
 I won’t forgive you!!!
 Black screen and haruka fucking kills the guy
 How dare you steal Aru's money?! I'll never forgive you! I'll make you wish you'd never been born!
 Haruka absolutely fucking kills him
 Eek.
 A-Aru said I should go and make my point...to do the calculations correctly…
 I-I thinkI made my point...?
 O-Oh! I didn't know there was someone else here!
 I-I'm so sorry for the commotion! I'm sorry f-for existing!
 O-Okay! Th-Then I have some bombs to install... Bye!
 I-I'm sorry.... I'm sorry. I just don't know how to do anything right. I'm sorry for upsetting you. Do you want me to disappear? I should never have been born.
