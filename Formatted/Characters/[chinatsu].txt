 I’m here to meet with the General Student Council president. The head prefect has terms she would like to discuss.
 There are also rumors a student under the Federal Corrections Bureau’s custody has escaped.
 …!
 …!
 Rin said defending the club room is paramount if they’re to regain control of Sanctum Tower.
 Hasumi is right. Sensei isn’t from Kivotos.
 Unlike us, a single bullet could put Sensei in grave danger. Don’t forget that!
 A student must listen to their teacher. We’ll be counting on you.
 I’ll be reporting what happened here to our head prefect. You’re welcome to stop by and visit if your work ever takes you to Gehenna Academy
 What about the others, Iori?
 Then all we can do is hope is that they stay out of our way...but procedure dictates that we state our intentions first.
 …
 …
 Scene change
 …
 The Abydos students are preparing for battle.
 Wait. Hold a moment, Iori.
 A civilian has been sighted on the Abydos side. One moment while we confirm.
 What is it?!
 That person over there. Could it be...? [NAME] Sensei from Schale?!
 W-Wait a minute. If Schale is working with them, then…
 We can't! We mustn't engage!
 *sigh*...
 <<Battle Sequence>>
 Despite being outnumbered, the Foreclosure Task Force is victorious with Sensei's guidance. After the battle, the senior administrator of Gehenna's Prefect Team, Ako, steps in to mediate. Meanwhile, Haruka hatches a conspiracy.
 …
 Sensei... I didn't expect us to meet again under these circumstances.
 I knew we had no hope of winning once I saw you standing there. We should have
 retreated. My apologies…
 Senior Administrator!
 (Very belatedly, I might add.)
 …!
 …Yes.
 President…
 Iori, are you okay?
 …I see.
 It’s called sympathy, Iori.
 (Why was I dragged into this?)
 Sensei…
 B-But I’m part of the Prefect Team now…
 I think I’ll have to decline…
 What about the President?
 Hasumi!
 Reinforcements are ready to go on your orders.
