 …
 Since you guys came back from the ruins.
 *scooches closer*
 Um. So, I mean…
 Th… Th…
 Thank you.
 Thank you for saying…the game was fun…and that you wished it wouldn’t end.
 And thank you for crying…It really means a lot.
 I’ve always wanted to hear those things said about our game…
 Anyway, It’s nice to meet you, Aris.
 Like Momoi said, my name is Yuzu, and I’m the president of the Game Development Department
 .	Thank you for joining our club, Aris.
 I look forward to making things with you.
 Uh, Y-Yeah. I think that covers it.
 It seems like you really understand our game. Getting new party members is one of the simple joys of playing an RPG.
 Oh, and if you want another fun game to play…
 …I do have a recommendation.
 Sorry but I can’t keep quiet about this. Her next game has to be Romancing NaGa. I don’t care what comes after that…
 Um. Good morning, everyone…
 *creak*
 …I’m sorry. I should have gone to the club meeting.
 …
 This is all my fault
 If you’re going back to the ruins…then I’m coming with you.
 I need to take responsibility for my mistake… This club belongs to everyone, not just me.
 For the sake of everyone, I want to protect it.
 Agh! Is everyone okay?
 If the robots keep coming like this, then…!
 It’s risky, but I-I won’t give up here.
 I get what you mean. Having Sensi around…definitely makes a difference…
 I’m running low, myself. I can probably only handle one more short firefight.
 Why does it think Aris’name is AL-1S?
 Let me plug the link cable, And…there!
 <Initiating transfer. Insufficient storage space detected. Deleting existing data. 9seconds remain.>
 I-It’s really here!
 *nod nod*
 Wh-Why does it seem so mad ?!
 *gulp*
 calm down, Momoi. This is all part of the plan.
 And by minute 20, we’ll all be arrested.
 N-Neru! It’s an emergency!
 M-My name’s Yuzu, and I’m with Seminar.
 The robots are out of c-control! It's a disaster!
 Akane and Karin are trying, but it’s just…
 I-I’m not sure… But they need help, and I heard y-you were here and I…
 I-I’ll stay and clean up. I don’t have any ammo or experience, so I-I’m scared of fighting…
 Pardon?
 H-H-Huh?! I, Uh… thank you.
 *gulp*
 *flop*
 …
 I-I thought I was dead for sure.
 I’m glad I made it in time.
 A-Anyway, that thing in Aris’ hands must be…
 …!
 There are a lot of robots ahead. Be careful!
 To reach our true goal, the G.BIBLE, we have to get the Mirror to Veritas club room!
 …
 I haven’t been so sad since Tales Saga Chronicle’s alpha update…
 Rage. Destruction. Desolation. Despair. Emptiness. All the world hurtles toward inevitable ruination…
 Wait… Th-That can’t be it right?
 Th-This is…for real, then?
 …
 Not long ago… just since you started talking about Tales Saga Chronicle.
 We should do it…
 I’ve always wanted to hear people say the game I made is fun…
 But the first version of Tales Saga Chronicle got thousands of negative comments, and people were brutal…
 I couldn't take it. So I locked myself away in the Game Development Department.
 But that’s when you guys came along.
 (Six months ago…)
 <Calling this a video game is pretty generous.>
 <I’d love to know what goes on in the mind of whoever made this.>
 <Ha. I can answer that. nothing obvs.>
 <This is why normies shouldn’t make games.>
 <When will they realize they are ruining the medium?>
 <seriously. This isn’t even a game. it’s just trash dressed up like a game.>
 Ugh…
 Please…I’m sorry, so please stop…
 I can’t do this anymore, so please… Please… Forgive me!
 *thud thud thud*
 Eek!
 Wh-Who’s there?!
 S-Seriously…IRL complaints?
 I-I’m sorry, all right. I’ll never make another game, so please just–
 …What?
 …?!
 Uh… Yes, I am.
 *gasp*
 …
 That’s how we met…
 Together, we finished Tales Saga Chronicle, and had the honor of winning the Worst Game of the Year.
 And then Aris appeared…
 When she said my game was fun, it filled my heart with joy.
 Creating a game while surrounded by wonderful people and getting to hear that others enjoy what we made… It’s always been my dream.
 But I’m also not ready for this dream to end.
 Let’s just do a quick test, and… Okay.
 There’s no errors, Momoi!
 Pheeew… That was too close.
 Huh?
 Let’s do it.
 Art is nothing if the people never get to experience it.
 I want people to experience what we made.
 It’s okay. Even if it’s just like last time, and I get an avalanche of nasty comments…
 …I’ll know that we did our best. And we did it together. That’s what’s truly important.
 I’m all right, honest.
 Me too.
 I’m too anxious to sleep anyway.
 So I’ll wait with you.
 Midori’s right.
 They clearly didn’t even try the game, so just try to ignore it.
 *ding*
 They think they’re going to hate it but want to try it anyway…
 *ding ding*
 Uhhh… They should really go take their test.
 Then what was it? Did our console finally die?
 Eek!
 Student Council forces are outside, maybe they’re here for revenge!
 What do we do now though?
 I went to the Student Council to discuss the building we destroyed.
 Thankfully they deemed it a product of a “sanctioned club accident.”
 I think C&C smoothed it over for us. And Neru said to me.
 “ See you soon.”
 Right…
 The Millennium Prize has begun.
 …
 Well, the Engineering Club is one of Millennium’s most valued clubs.
 *gulp*
 Please… Please…
 It’s okay, midori.
 I’m going back to the dorms.
 I don’t think anyone will call us failures anymore. And if they ro, it doesn’t bother me now.
 Because I have you guys…and sensei.
 I want to thank you, Sensei.
 Ever since you came to this club room, we’ve all grown and changed.
 But for Aris…
 guys, please don’t pressure Sensei. if anyone were to find out…
 *slam*
 What the…heck?
 Not exactly,
 …
 …
 Take a long look at the most liked comment thread…
 *gasp*
 Thank goodness… We really did it.
 Let’s keep making games together!
 The dream lives on!
