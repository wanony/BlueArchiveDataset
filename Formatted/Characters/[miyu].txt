 U-Um… I think that something is me…
 Are you gonna blow me up with everything?
 I-I’m happy to hear that…
 …All the enemies have gone away. Can I come back now?
 It’s all humid and dark, and there’s bugs everywhere.
 And it’s scary being all by myself.
 I don’t want that either…
 Whatever you say, Saki…
 …Saki. Target altitude is 900m, distance is 2,500m, and compass point is 0-3-0…
 W-Was that another bug? I’m scared… I wanna go home.
 Oh but they closed the SRT building so I don’t have a
 home to go to.
 And Valkyrie would never let me join them now…
 I’m just gonna be left here forgotten and alone…
 Are they sure I can’t leave yet…?
 click
 Huh?
 A smoke b-bomb?
 boom
 Eek!
 They didn’t warn me any enemies were approaching!
 I-I need to report this right away.
 A silhouette approaches
 D-Don’t move! Or I’ll shoot!
 The RABBIT Squad?
 S-Saki?
 But Saki, you were the one who said to not leave our positions no matter what.
 A-And you sound kinda funny…
 (...This is weird. She doesn’t talk or sound like Saki at all…)
 (Use your brain, Miyu!)
 …Clover.
 You don’t know? Saki would know the watchword and the countersign!
 Y-You better answer or I’ll shoot!
 Huh?! I said it first!
 B-But… THat doesn’t…
 F-Fine! Carrot!
 Wh-What do you mean?
 L-Liar!
 Black screen with gunshots
 I-It’s all over… Gone…
 The SRT Academy, the RABBIT Squad, my home… Now I’m really going to be forgotten for good… Not just by my squad members…
 K-Kasumizawa Miyu, I’m a 1st year in RABBIT Squad… My role is the sniper…
 I’m fifteen years old… I was born on July twelfth. O-Oh…and I like collecting p-pebbles.
 What’s gonna happen to me?
 I know what I did in the park was really bad… A-Am I going to be tortured?
 Like ticking me all night, or playing the same song on repeat over and over again…
 Nooo! P-Please don’t do it! I’m sorry! I’ll tell you everything!
 B-Because…I was scared of being transferred to a new school.
 N-No it’s not like that…
 It’s just that… I don’t wanna have to make new friends all over again…
 I mean… Miyako’s the only one who ever really cares about me… But at least I have her.
 If I have to go to a whole, brand-new school…
 Who would talk to me? I’m a crybaby and useless. I’ll fade away into nothingness like a piece of gum on the street nobody even notices.
 I’d rather sleep with those icky bugs than meet new people.
 N-No, not exactly. But people can forget me.
 And I can’t stand the thought of being forgotten. All by myself… Like a piece of gum…
 That’s why I went to SRT. But now my only home is gone, and I’m really scared…
 A-Avoid people?
 So, if I join your club, I could go to school and never talk to anyone, ever?
 Can I just go back to the bugs?
 Kasumizawa  Miyu
 Fail
 Miyako… Thank goodness.
 B-But, what if it’s even scarier than getting kicked out of school?
 M-Me?!
 …It’s over for us.
 …
 Eeeek!
 …N-Noooo!
 I-I just wanna go back home…
 You probably h-hate us because of what happened…
 A-Are you going to blackmail us?
 I-I still think Sensei is scary…
 I g-guess it’s the closest to home we have…
 M-Miyako! Wait for me!

 06 - Food Delivery Operation
 The next day, Sensei visits the park and finds the squad members starving. They continue to decline Sensei’s help, so Sensei tells them about a place to get free food instead. When the squad members arrive there, they learn that the free food is discarded bentos from a nearby convenience store.
 (The next morning, I went to the park to check on how the RABBIT Squad was doing.)
 [In Front of Kousagi Park]
 Walking
 Sensei falls
 Scene turns black
 E-Eeek… I-It’s Sensei.
 And there’s lots of shade too, so lookout duty isn’t bad.
 I wanna go home…
 Y-You see, Sensei…
 Th-There are some shops around, but our student accounts were suspended so we have no money.
 And now we’re going to be left here, forgotten and starved. Slowly wasting away into nothingness…
 I-I wanna go back to the SRT building… It’s not fair.
 Is that…
 Is this a new form of t-torture?
 This is worse torture than tickling…but I’ll do my best.
 The thick, salty broth is seeping into the barely set egg…turning it into a savory pudding-like treat…
 I agree! That was m-mean, Sensei…
 M-Maybe our conviction swayed Sensei’s mind.
 Is this the end for us?
 Is this our lives now? Begging for food like stray dogs, never knowing the sweet comfort of a home-cooked meal…
 H-Hi. I’m still here. C-Can I eat this Vienna sausage bento?
 I-I promise we’re not fighting over old expired bentos.
 I-Is it resolved? We’ve just been scrounging for thrown-out bentos…
 I don’t wanna wash in public restrooms anymore… You can’t even take a real shower in them.
 Wh-Wh-What are you gonna do while we shower? Are you gonna steal all our weapons?
 Maybe, it won’t matter…
 I-I think that’ll just make everything dirtier. Including us.
 That’s expensive. We’re a buncha broke students.
 …
 I-I don’t wanna pick sides…
 Uh, Saki…
 I mean, RABBIT 2. Where should I stand by?
 S-Saki! He’s coming towards me! Wh-Wh-What do I do?
 I suck at hand-to-hand stuff. Can I run away…
 Wh-Where did everyone go?
 Saki? Miyako? Anyone at all? S-Sensei?
 If I talk too loud, the guards’ll come and get me… And… And I think I forgot my radio…
 It’s really happening this time. They forgot I exist and went back home.
 I’ll fade away like a bad dream… Th-They’ll laugh and make memories while I turn into dust on this crane…
 Barrel approaches
 Gyah! What’s that?
 Barrel rummages
 It… It moved?! It’s a moving drum barrel!
 It knows my name? Wait… It’s talking?!
 Wh-What the heck is that? A new UMA? Or the creepy-crawling doom of impending chaos?
 It’s a monster! It wants to eat my alive!
 P-Please spare me, barrel monster! I’m tiny so I’m not yummy, I promise!
 I’ve been abandoned and forgotten in this cold lonely world… A-And now… I’m gonna be gobbled up by the evil barrel monster?
 I WANNA GO HOME!
 Saki?
 Waaah… Saki… I thought you forgot about me for good! *sniffles*
 Okay… *sniffle*
 B-Because reality is different from our textbooks…
 I-It’s perfect now, b-but what if it gets hotter and hotter and all of a sudden we’re boiling?
 Haven’t you heard about frogs slowly b-boiling alive?
 I-I knew the creepy teacher was gonna do b-bad things to us while we’re vulnerable!
 I-I want the top-quality wagyu bento, please.
 I’ve n-never had wagyu meat before, even at SRT.
 Oh… Hi, Sensei.
 W-We’re surrounded…
 I-I can p-probably take down the snipers on the second floor.
 Site A clear.
 And I took out a-all the snipers, too…
 M-Miyako, I found a buncha other stuff too. Sleeping bags, tarpaulins…
 We can put this under us when we sleep! The ground get so damp when it rains.
 M-Me too…
 Th-That was the last of it. We’re all out.
 I-It was a bolt of lighting…that hit the park…
 The c-command tent caved in…
 S-Saki…
 M-Miyako… I wanna g-go home.
 I wanna help.
 Fade to black
 (The RABBIT member and I worked tirelessly on repairing the spillway for hours.)
 You sh-shouldn’t talk to your Sensei like that, Moe…
 H-Halt! Stay back, or I’ll shoot!
 ?
 Oh… I-I’m sorry!
 I-I don’t think you would, but you didn’t buy these, d-did you?
 I-I knew you were gonna say something like that…
 But we have no more supplies and no one’s g-gonna help us.
 They’re probably j-just waiting for us to be too weak to f-fight back.
 And then we’re g-gonna be sold on the black market and t-t-tortured! Noooo!
 W-We have no money, and n-no way of making
 some.
 We have expired yakiniku bentos…
 M-Moe… I don’t want you to go to j-jail…!
 They even paid us in cash…
 I’ve never seen so much cash in my life…
 M-Maybe you mixed them up with the Security Bureau?
 B-But this kinda weaponry has to be s-super expensive…
 …
 Fade to black
 B-But how come the P-Public Peace Bureau is arresting us?
 Sh-Shouldn’t the Security Bureau do that k-kinda stuff?
 I-Is that enough for us to w-win though? We don’t even have ammo…
 Miyako, h-help…
 …
 The chief mentioned a sponsor…
 W-We might not be great right now, but we’re not that bad.
 A-Are we doomed?
 …
 E-Even with supplies and backup, I think it’s impossible…
 We would f-fail on our own…
 B-But… Do we have the authority?
 We don’t even have a real school anymore.
 S-So stupid… Heehee.
 …A-And silently liquidate them before anyone is the wiser.
 W-Wow! You hacked it so fast, Moe!
 Umm, wh-where’s Sensei?
 Th-That’s right… We’ve always p-pulled through with just us…
 Th-This is the archive room of all their d-documents…
 Moe is p-probably trying to crack the code…
 I-I hate dark spaces…
 W-Well…i-it’s closed…
 Th…The thing is… The d-d-door…
 There’s no handle from the inside.
 …
 I… I… W-Well, I thought someone might s-see if I left the door open…
 S-Sorry…
 W-Waaaaaaaah!
 I-I had no business joining the SRT…
 A d-dumb scaredy-cat who d-drags everyone else down.
 I wish I’d never been born! Waaaaaah!
 Th-This is really it… I w-wanna go home…
 M-Miyako… Help…
 I-I’m always s-scared and lonely on sniper duty…
 But y-you’re the only person who’s never forgotten me, Miyako.
 B-But…
 The alarms are still going off…
 Got ‘em!
 But I only have one shot left in my chamber! I need to reload!
 I-I doubted it too… But Miyako did say to follow her orders blindly.
 It worked out in the end.
 W-We don’t say it but…we’ve always had faith in you as our leader.
 Y-Your orders, Miyako.
 Th-They’re already at the rooftop door?
 Are we gonna last five minutes?
 G-Good thing there’s no zombies in real life…
 EEEEK! A r-r-real zombie!
 W-We were scared and unsure when this all started…
 S-So sleepy…
 I’m just gonna lay down right here…
 I-It’s all they’ve been t-talking about on the
 news…
 Wh-What if the Public Peace Bureau tries to get r-r-revenge?
 Th-This isn’t karaage…
