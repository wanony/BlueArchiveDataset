 Welcome back, Shiro...ko?
 Who's that riding on your back?!
 Everyone, calm down. We have to help her hide the body! Go grab a shovel and pickaxe from the storage!
 A visitor? Are you sure you didn't kidnap them?
 You're with Schale? The Federal Investigation Club?!
 She's taking a nap in the next room. I'll go wake her up.
 Serika leaves
 <*pop* *pop* *pop* *tat*>
 I've got Hoshino! Now if she'd just wake up!
 Wake up and get your butt in gear, Hoshino! Literally! We have to defend the school!
 Hahaha! How do you like that, Helmet Gang?
 You shouldn't tease Shiroko like that, Hoshino! Besides, haven't you slept enough today?
 Hey.
 Yeah, probably. Man, I hate them.
 What the...?! Hoshino came up with a plan?!
 Well? Spill it.
 Thanks, Ayane. You too.
 Haha! All we have to focus on now is paying back the debt!
 Thanks for your help, Sensei. We won't forget what you did for us!
 Wait... Shoot!
 Stop right there! Not another word, Ayane!
 That doesn't mean we should go telling everyone!
 I know, but they're still an outsider.
 Well…
 Sensei just showed up out of nowhere! Why would an adult care about our problems,	 anyway?
 We've always taken care of ourselves! Why do we suddenly need to be supervised?
 I don't want any part of this!
 Serika leaves
 …
 Hmph.
 Serika walks away
 Nonomi walks around
 Ugh. It's you again.
 Good morning! Wait, no! Don't act like we're friends!
 Hmph. Whatever.
 Don't you have anything better to do than loiter around so early in the morning? And you
 call yourself an adult…
 What's with you?! Stop acting like you know me!
 What I do is none of your business.
 Look at you hanging around with nothing better to do. I hope I never grow up to be as aimless as you.
 Why don't you buzz off and bother someone else? I'm busy.
 What? You want to walk to school together?
 Why on earth should I go with you?
 Besides, it's our day off. I don't have class.
 Huh? Then where am I going? What business is that of yours?
 I'm outta here. Bye!
 <Serika ran away.>
 Huh? Why are you following me?!
 You wanna know where I'm going?
 What are you talking about? Go away, you stalker!
 Ugh! Fine! I'lljust tell you.
 I'm going to my part-time job.
 I don't have the freedom to just slack off all day like you do.
 I have money to make.
 There, happy now? So stop following me!
 Serika whisks away
 Ugh. You're so annoying.
 What? Where do I work?
 Would you go away already, you idiot?! You're cruising for a bruising if you don't leave me alone.
 <Serika ran away again.>
 Welcome to Shiba Seki Ramen!
 How many are in your party? I'll show you to your seats.
 just a minute! Extra noodles for table three!
 <*door opens*>
 Welcome to Shiba Seki…
 What the...?!
 What are you guys doing here?
 Sensei is with you too...? I knew you were stalking me!
 So it was you, Hoshino? Ugh.
 Y-Yes, sir. Follow me. I'll take you to your table.
 It's too narrow! Sitting that close can't possibly be comfortable for Sensei. Move a little this way.
 What are you doing?!
 /
 But there are plenty of seats! Can't you all just sit like NORMAL people?
 There's enough seats for each of you, so just sit down like normal SANE people!
 /
 Wh-What are you talking about? It had nothing to do with that! I just used to be a regular here, that's all…
 Maybe about a week.
 Would you all shut up already and place an order?!
 Ugh... May I take your order?
 Did you all bring your own money? You're not just going to make Nonomi pay again, are you?
 Would you all get out of here already?! And never come back! You're nothing but a bunch of busybodies.
 I hate you! I won't forget this!
 Phew. It's finally over. What a busy day.
 I can't believe all of them showed up like that. And they were so loud.
 Did they really have to come all the way out here to blabber on like that?
 "Sensei! Sensei!" Ugh. They're so annoying.
 Damn you, Hoshino! She probably planned to bring Sensei here after what happened
 yesterday.
 Hmph. You think I'm going to fall for it that easily? Yeah, right…
 Serika walks away
 Helmet Gangsters appear
 …
 Hmm…
 This neighborhood gets emptier by the day. There used to be a lot more people.
 And it's becoming less safe too…
 No. We gotta stay strong. It's up to us to bring the school back from the brink.
 I can pay back a little bit more of the debt once I get my paycheck, and then…
 Dozens of helmet gangsters appear
 …?!
 What do you want?!
 The Kata-Kata Helmet Gang? You have a lot of nerve coming back here!
 Actually, I'm glad you're here. I've been in a bad mood today. I'll make you regret ever
 showing your faces here again!
 <*pop* *pop* *pop* *pop* *tat*!>
 H-Huh?!
 (From behind too? It's an ambush.)
 *cough* *cough*
 (An anti-aircraft gun? No... Could that sound have been from an improved Flak 41 model?)
 (Fire support? Where are they...? Not good.)
 (They aren't messing around this time. This is dangerous...)
 (I'm...losing consciousness...)
 (...)
 <*flop*>
 Ugh…
 Huh?
 …?!
 Where am I? Was I kidnapped?!
 Ow... My head.
 <*clunk* *clunk*>
 Is this the back of a truck?
 The Helmet Gang... Where could they be taking me?
 It's dark, but there is a little bit of light coming through the crack in the door.
 Maybe I can see something outside…
 Sand...and a railroad?
 Does that mean we're in the desert on the outskirts of Abydos?
 No... There's nothing but wasteland out here and no way to get a signal. I won't be able to contact the others even ifI do manage to escape.
 What should I do? They must be worried sick about me.
 …
 Are they going to bury me somewhere in the desert so no one can find me?
 Maybe the team will think I bailed on them and left like all the other students…
 Will they think I betrayed them?
 Is this how I'm going to die...?
 No. I can't let that happen…
 …
 Ugh…
 *sniffle*
 *booooom*
 Wh-What was that?!
 <*thump* *crash*>
 *cough* *cough*
 Smoke subsides
 What the heck? An explosion? Why did that truck blow up out of nowhere?!
 Where are these shells coming from?
 A-Ayane?!
 …?!
 Ugh! You guys are so annoying! I wasn't crying!
 Damn it! Could you be any more grating?! I said I wasn't crying, so shut up already!
 What? You're here too, Sensei?! But why?
 What are you talking about? You're such a perv!
 /
 Are you...
 N/A
 /
 What did you just say? Are you stupid? Have a DEATHWISH?!Wh-Who are you calling a princess?!
 Ayane…
 Be careful. Those goons have a modified heavy tank.
 Uh-huh. I'll be fine. Never better…
 *stumbles*
 <*collapses*>
 Huh?
 Wait... Sensei?! What are you doing here?!
 Oh. I'm fine. I shouldn't be spending so much time lying around doing nothing anyway.
 I don't want to worry Ayane or the others too much. Plus, I have my part-time job to go to.
 Y-You don't have to worry about me so much! I'm fine, really.
 …
 Uh, so... By the way!
 Th-The thing is…
 Looking back on it, I don't think I ever thanked you, Sensei…
 S-So...thanks. For all the help and stuff…
 But still! Don't assume this has done anything to actually help our school! We're gonna settle this debt if it's the last thing we do!
 …
 Wh-What?! What's with that smug look on your face?!
 *sigh* Geez.
 Whatever... I'll see you tomorrow!
 Sen…
 …Sensei.
 Serika leaves
 <<To be Continued>>
 08 - The Might of Problem Solver 68
 The Foreclosure Task Force struggles to come up with ideas on how to pay off the school's debt. Sensei and the students run into the impoverished employees of Problem Solver 68 while grabbing some ramen after the meeting.
 [Foreclosure Task Force Room]
 Come on. You say that like we've never taken it seriously before…
 Ooh! Me! Me!
 Seriously, again with the formalities? I hate it when you do that…
 *sigh* Fine. You guys do have seniority here, I guess…
 Moving on! The school is on the verge of bankruptcy. And I'm the treasurer, in case you
 forgot, so I really mean it!
 Abydos will seriously get shut down at this rate. Got it?
 We're paying nearly 8 million yen every month alone. We're doing everything we can to hold on, but that much is barely keeping up with the interest.
 There's only so much we can do by just arresting wanted criminals or taking care of
 civilian requests.
 We're royally screwed unless something changes. What we need is something big! Huge, even!
 This is it! It's a flier from downtown!
 That's right! We're all gonna become boss babe billionaires!
 I was downtown recently, and these really cool people invited me to a seminar. They told me all about these amazing germanium bracelets! Did you know they can cleanse your aura and bring you good luck?
 They're so powerful that you can boost your good vibes just by wearing them! They're so powerful that you can boost your good vibes just by wearing them!
 !
 What? Why are you looking at me like that?
 What?! Why?!
 What?!
 N-No way! I already bought two bracelets, so that can't be right!
 …!
 B-But...it sounded so convincing. I even skipped lunch so I could buy these…
 *sniff* Aww. Nonomi…
 Heck no it isn't! Absolutely not! DENIED!
 Why not? You'd definitely have some fans, Hoshino.
 Are you…
 ...KIDDING ME?! The Swimsuit WHAT?! Get real!
 I mean, at least this means becoming pop idols is off the table...right?
 This is a joke...right? We aren't really…
 Really?
 *flinches*
 That's fine and all, but did you guys seriously have to come back here again?
 Welcome! How many in your party?
 Our lowest priced dish?
 That would be the regular Shiba Seki Ramen Bowl for 580 yen! It's our signature dish
 and super tasty too!
 Hmm?
 <*door opens*>
 2 more students walk in
 So, four in your party? I'll show you to your seats.
 Just one...? Still, you may as well be comfortable. Plus we're not very busy at the moment.
 Four pairs? Uh, you're not thinking of splitting a single bowl between the four of you, are you?
 What the...?! You don't have to apologize to ME over something like that…
 Don't say that! Being poor isn't a crime or anything to be ashamed of. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself!
 You're students! No one expects you to be loaded with cash. Still, you and your friends scraped enough to share a bowl of ramen together. That's saying something, isn't it?
 Hang tight. I'd be glad to bring it out for you.
 Serika walks away
 Order up! The bowl's hot, so be careful!
 <*thud*>
 This is exactly what you ordered: a plain 580-yen Shiba Seki Ramen Bowl. Isn't that right, Master?
 Master says it's all good, so don't worry! Enjoy your meal!
 Take care on your way home!
 You guys are the ones attacking us?! After I gave you all that extra ramen?! You ungrateful pricks!
 Don't say it! I'm gonna snap ifI hear the details!
 Just face it. We'll never pay this off in our lifetimes! Why even bother doing the math?!
 I hope you aren't planning to rob them, Shiroko.
 That doesn't mean you can daydream about doing it either!
 Geez, Ayane. You're acting like this is personal. Is there something you want to tell us about?
 Then how did they get their hands on it?
 So this is the Black Market…
 Not thatI know, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that this place isn't anything like an aquarium.
 Peroro?
 You never did care for cutesy stuff, Hoshino.
 We're practically the same age…
 What?!
 Scene change
 Why do we keep getting involved with these rough-and-tumble types everywhere we go? Is it us?
 Tch. They should consider themselves lucky!
 A bank and police force?! That can't be legal, can it?!
 No, no, not a kidnapping. They mean they'd like you to be our guide. That is, if you're okay with it, Hifumi.
 *sigh* I'm beat.
 Like I said, we're all pretty much the same age!
 What?! Nonomi, are you gonna use your card again?!
 *nom* *nom*
 That's tasty!
 The Stygian Bank?
 That's ridiculous! Why isn't the General Student Council doing anything?!
 What the heck?! That's the bank employee who takes our interest payments every month…
 So we've essentially been funding criminal activities for the Black Market this entire time?!
 Hold on. You can't be serious. You three aren't thinking what I think you're thinking...are you?
 Was that a yes?! Seriously?!
 This is actually happening. We're really doing this?
 Because if you three are serious…
 ...then count me in too!
 What's to explain? We're hitting a criminal bank! We're the good guys!
 Hey, you over there! You were told to get down on the ground! Try any more funny business and I'll put holes in your circuits!
 Hey, when did we agree to give ourselves names?! And what kind of choice is that? It's so lame!
 Hey, Shiro—I mean, uh...B|ue. You got the goods?
 Phew, that was starting to get really stuffy. We can take these off now, right?
 Hey, Shiroko...why are you still wearing that? Isn't it hot?
 Thank goodness Shiroko ended up at Abydos. I bet she would have become a criminal mastermind if she had gone to a different school.
 …
 Nice! We did it!
 WH-WHAT?! Shiroko, you went after the cash instead?!
 Nice going! What are you all staring at each other for? Let's take it!
 What's wrong, Ayane? This is our chance to settle the debt.
 We're the ones who shed blood, sweat, and tears to earn this cash in the first place! It was that evil bank who decided to funnel it away into crime!
 This money would have funded more weapons, ammo, and who knows what else for the
 real bad guys! Fine, we stole from some criminals. So what? Where's the harm there?!
 See? Told you! And this will help with Abydos High School's debts for sure!
 What?!
 …
 Argh! You have to be kidding me! You want us to just dump all this cash?! Of all the times to take a stand, this is when you do it?!
 (What is SHE doing here?)
 (What the heck is she going on about...?)
 (N-Nonomi?!)
 (...)
 (She's acting like a star-struck little girl.)
 (That ought to be enough, right? Let's start looking for a way out!)
 What?!
 I think I'm going to be sick to my stomach. Gah! I can't believe this!
 What in the heck is this?!
 Right after they took our cash, they delivered it straight to the Helmet Gang's base to fund their mission?!
 …
 Fun? Speak for yourself, Shiroko.
 What?! N-No way! Why would that place be a target for anyone?
 No way... Could they have been targeting me?!
 I-I can't believe it! I really hope Master is all right…
 <*woosh*>
 You jerks... We've given you the benefit of the doubt over and over again, but this is how it really is, huh?!
 Perfect. That means we can get as rough as we want then, right?
 You'll pay for this!
 I hope you know what you've gotten yourselves into!
 It sounded like…
 Is the Prefect Team here to take those Problem Solver kids into custody?!
 Fat chance we'll allow it! Those Problem Solver scumbags are ours! Who the hell do they think the are?!
 …
 I get what you're asking us, but what are we supposed to do about it?
 …
 Yeah, that's right! How dare they? They're basically spitting in our faces!
 We're the ones who're going to take Problem Solver down! I'm gonna make sure they
 pay for what they did to Shiba Seki Ramen!
 Scene change
 …
 …
 The Abydos student council is long gone! For all intents and purposes, we’re now the acting student council here. So if you’ve got anything to say, you can say it to us!
 They actually did it…
 …
 (All three of them have serious, decisive expressions on their faces)
 What?! Of course they’re a bunch of rotten apples! They blew up the ramen shop!
 What?!
 Huh. I guess you have a point.
 They laid a trap and then sprung it on themselves by accident? Geez. Who would hire those idiots?
 What the heck? How’d they get all the way there?
 Wh-What?!
 (With a nervous expression)
 …
 *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp*
 (The troops keep moving)
 (With a serious expression)
 …
 So your plan is to kidnap Sensei? Do you really think we’re gonna let that happen?
 All right! We’re working with Problem Solver! Let’s wipe out those arrogant little twerps!
 *pant* *pant* Again?!
 “President”? You mean it’s the head prefect?!
 That’s a lie!
 H-Holy crap…
 …
 So?
 What?!
 What took you so long?! It was nuts here! Those Gehenna punks were…
 ?!
 Shiroko must have the blood of warriors… Then again, I’m not one to turn down a fight either.
 Ayane…
 Got it. I need a shower, anyway…
 Are you all right, Master?
 But what about your shop?
 Why are you apologizing? I can’t exactly work in a building that’s been leveled.
 R-Really? The property was sold? To whom?!
 H-Huh? What is it? I’ll go with you, Ayane!
 Master! Don’t even think about retiring yet, all right?
 I don’t know where we’re going, but okay… See you later, Sensei!
 [TO BE CONTINUED]
 Episode 4 - Everyone Has a Story Part 1
 Guys, this is bad! Look at this!
 …Why does everything feel so tense?
 O-Okay. More importantly!
 We’ve just learned something very serious!
 Yes, it’s urgent! Everyone, please take a look at this!
 *flap*
 No, that’s not true!
 …
 What have they done? Those idiot Student Council members!
 How could they sell the school’s land to the Kaiser Corporation?!
 The school belongs to the students! Why would they do something like this?!
 Oh, really? Is that true?
 The student with the lowest grades was the student body president? What kind of a Student Council is that?
 Grades don’t indicate whether someone is suited for a job, Serika.
 Oh. Really?!
 I’m not sure if that’s a compliment…
 What? That’s so weird…
 Huh? What do you mean, Sensei?
 H-Huh?
 I can’t believe it! They played right into the hands of those Kaiser bastards!
 The Student Council was so stupid! How could they fall into their trap so easily?!
 Sensei?
 (Shakes a little)
 …
 I-I know that! I’ve bought sketchy stuff like germanium bracelets! I know better than anyone that the con artists are the bad guys!
 But…
 I still feel so angry… Why?
 Why would they do something so cruel to Abydos? We were already struggling…
 Huh?
 Come on! What is there to think about?
 The Abydos Desert is in our district! Why don’t we just go?
 If you’re so curious about what’s out there, then let’s go and see for ourselves!
 What is this feeling? Is this what it’s like to be supported?
 By the way, Ayane. Isn’t it weird that the Gehena head prefect is the one who gave us that info?
 How does a student from another academy know so much about what’s going on in our district?
 R-Really?!
 And…
 *flashback*
 We’ll be working in the desert from here on out…
 What? There’s an oasis here?
 Festivals…and crowds…in a desert like this? I don’t believe it
 Wh-What is this…?
 Whoa, what?!
 *Fade to black*
 They’re not that strong, but they’re definitely a pain to deal with…more than anything I’ve ever faced before.
 K-Kaiser… You mean there guys are also with the Kaiser Corporation?
 I’m so sick of them! Everywhere I go, all I see is Kaiser, Kaiser, Kaiser! What is their deal?!
 What is it?
 Mercenaries?!
 A-Army? Y-You mean they’re not students?
 It’s coming from every direction… This is not good…
 *pant *pant*
 L-Looks like someone important just showed up…
 What are you talking about? Problem Solver?
 C-Creditor?!
 *Hoshino appears next to the Kaiser PMC Director with an angry expression*
 That’s right! You’re the culprit who hired the Helmet Gang and Problem Solver to come after us! Aren’t you?!
 You’re the reason that Abydos…that Abydos is…
 …!
 …That’s a bold-faced lie!
 Wh-What? Who did you just call? Proceed?
 Did you say 90 million yen?! Wh-What are you talking about?!
 Ah, w-wait… This is…
 …
 It’s OUR school now! We can’t just abandon it!
 Hoshino?!
 Seriously! What the hell are we gonna do?!
 It doesn’t matter! What are we supposed to do about this debt? How are we supposed to pay the rest of it off in less than a month?!
 That’s only going to make things worse, Shiroko! we should be focusing on how to pay off the debt!
 …Fine! If our backs are against the wall and the school really is doomed, then we have nothing to lose. I’m in!
 It’s not like I want to. All I’m saying is…
 I-I…
 …
 HOSHINO!
 Wh-What the hell?! After talking all high and mighty?! She’s the one giving up just because the going got tough!
 Does she think I’ll let her get away with this?
 Wh-Wha…?!
 What’s happening?! Why is Kaiser attacking us?! I don’t understand…
 First, we have to take care of the enemies in the school! We’re counting on you, Ayane!
 Back off! Unless you’ve got a death wish!
 Give Hoshino back, you bastards!
 …
 Wh-What are you talking about?
 That’s nonsense! Even if the student council is disbanded, Abydos still has the Foreclosure Task Force! We’re right here!
 Ayane?
 What?!
 What do you mean?!
 …!
 Shut your mouth before I shut it for you…
 Ayane?!
 Oh, Ayane…
 Right! Hoshino needs us!
 Who cares if we’re unauthorized or whatever? Whether we’re above board or not, if we don’t rescue Hoshino, then…
 …
 Sensei!
 Uh…
 What?!
 That’s so corny and cliche! Are you TRYING to make me cringe?!
 You will?!
 Are you serious?!
 Help yourselves! I have too much dignity to stoop that low!
 What about Problem Solver?
 Why not?! Think of all the trouble they caused us!
 We’re well-rested and working on full stomachs too!
 I’m fine!
 Is it…a school?
 It’s in ruins, but it must be.
 You…!
 What in the…?! What are you guys doing here?
 …Tch.
 You don’t even want my thanks, do you?
 So when this is all over…let’s just get some ramen together or something!
 Seriously… How many more times are you gonna get in the way?!
 You were seriously trying to bully a bunch of girls into giving up on their school… How low can a slimeball like you get?!
 Welcome back, Hoshino.
 Sh-Shut up! It doesn’t matter who says it first!
 Sh-Shut up! Don’t keep us in suspense!
 Sh-Shut up! Don’t keep us in suspense!
 Welcome to Shiba Seki Ramen!
 What are you talking about?! It may not be as hectic as before, but now’s not the time to be lazing around!
 I’m the treasurer around here. We’re just as much an economic crisis as ever before!
 That’s why I’ve been keeping up with the latest economic trends!
 Look at this. Do you know what it is?
 It’s called a GPU! With one of these, we could mine a cryptocurrency called Scam Coin!
 Cryptocurrencies are like these, uh… Wh-What? Why are you all looking at me like that?
 When did that become the motto?! And stop trying to give us a backstory!
 Not to mention that time she turned an entire Kaiser PMC unit into dust!
 I-I was just following their lead, for the record!
 Stop joking around and take that off already, Shiroko!
 Shiroko unmasks
 You started it by referring to her title to begin with. Do you even remember HER name?
 Locked and loaded!
