 Thank goodness. I was not sure you were going to ever wake up.
 Indeed, mortal. Gaze upon me and know it to be true.
 …?
 Strange item obtained!
 A student ID?
 One of you? As in, I am an ally?
 Bum bum bum! Ariss has joined the party!
 By that you mean?
 That is a new word. “En…gineer…ing”?
 Disagreed. I have already saved humanity 27 times, defeated the demon king 46 times, and explored hundreds of dungeons.
 *staring intently*
 *weird cannon*
 Is that…?
 Who are you?
 …?
 …!
 The Sword of Light?!
 Wow! Incredible!
 I…want one.
 What reasons, though?
 Is my level too low? What stats do I need to equip this gun?

 Oh?!
 Are you certain nothing beguiles your thought, technomage?
 *nod*
 *scooches forward*
 She who lifts this weapon on high…

 Umm…So how does button layout work? Would this be the R trigger…?
 Blinding Light!
 *boooom*
 …Amazing.
 I will equip this to my weapon slot.
 Th-Thank you!
 Oh?!
 Combat drones and robots detected. Danger confirmed.
 Here they come!
 Hooray!
 I understand the strategy. Our gear ready, and I posted the announcement “Beginners welcome - 4 man Burning Forest Expedition - healers/DPS needed.” Ah. Peroro32 joined.
 Evasive maneuvers! Casting protection magic.
 I am known as Aris the Blue Eyes. A dwarven lancer wielding the Flame Dragon Fang gunlance, I hail from the Steel Mountains, but lost my family at an early age to a demon attack–
 Oh, understood.
 Hello. My name is Aris. I am a first-year here at the Millennium School. I recently transferred, but missed registration, so I will not be starting my classes until next month
 Even though I am not in any classes yet, I was told I could still join a club, so I ended up joining the Game Development Department.
 My role in the Game Development Department is to tank and deal light-type melee damage…
 R-Right! Programming… I learned to code in JABA before I ever spoke my first word…
 …?
 Huh?
 Oh.
 It is here, the specter…
 *gulp*
 I-Is it possible to achieve a bad ending depending on the answers I choose?
 *blankly stares into the distance*
 Well, when I woke up, I was here… Wait, no, that is not right…
 I, um… I wanted to play Castlemania and then I heard there was a game club here…
 Tank and light-type melee fighter…
 Whoops! I-I mean…I am a… p-p-pro glamor!
 Oh, yes, that one! I am the very picture of the perfect programmer.
 Oh, yes, it is tough being a programmer. Sometimes we die from working too much.
 But it’s not actually that big of a deal!
 Yeah! Usually, you just wake up at an inn or give money to the cathedral, and you are totally revived.
 Hm? It is common sense, really. Have you not played The Fable of Heroes or any of the games in the Brother series?
 They are very good. You should give them a try.
 Uh…
 Bum bum bum! Yuzu has joined the party!
 *nod*
 Today my role is…light-type AOE DPS…
 Targeting front line threats.
 Blinding Light!
 *boom*
 We can do it.
 As a team of four, we have explored 27 dungeons and carried out 139 successful raids to date.
 If we are together, there is nothing we cannot do.
 Do not worry
 I will protect Sensei no matter what happens.
 Sensei, are you with us?
 …!
 Bum bum bum! Sensei has joined the party!
 Entry successful, Objective complete.
 My battery is…blinking. Is my MP low?
 This place is…?
 Oh.
 …
 I am…not sure. Something feels familiar. We have to go this way
 There is no data of this place in memory. but…my body knows it.
 It is like playing a game you last played many years ago
 Without a tutorial or explanation, you still have a sense of where to go.
 *swoop*
 Keyboard obtained. Searching for G.BIBLE. *click clack*
 I-I did not press enter, though…
 <Identity check, are you AL-1S?>
 Hmm?
 No. I am…me. I am “Aris”
 …
 My name is actually…?
 Computer, do you know about Al-1S
 <…>
 <…>
 My heart is beating really fast.
 Who is Himari?
 Before we enter the dungeon, we become a raid party.
 I believe in us.
 When the world is on the brink of destruction, the legendary hero must rise to save it by defeating the wicked demon lord.
 After playing approximately 45 RPGs…I have determined that there is a powerful weapon all these legendary heroes have in common.
 Uh… No.
 they fight alongside their friends
 Ah! *sparkle sparkle*
 ???
 Gah!
 I-I am down!
 Resurrection spell…please…
 *flop*
 Oh.
 A blackout. So that means…
 *clank*
 The EMP went off and Hare hacked the system settings. Which means the doors in the Student Council build should be open as well as the shutters.
 All right.
 Jail break time.
 And the next quest marker is at…
 …the Student Council contraband storage.
 [Millennium Main Hallway]
 Momoi! Midori!
 Now!
 I did a lot of thinking on my way to the contraband storage room.
 Final Fantasia, Dragon Crest, Tales of Destiny, Chrono Digger, The Fable of Heroes, Pyre Emblem, and…Tales Saga Chronicle.
 No matter which game you look at…
 The heroes never, ever, leave their friends behind.
 So I will not, either.
 We will get through these trials–together!
 My HP is not critical.
 …?
 Everyone, please mute yourselves.
 Someone is coming. Based on the footsteps, they are alone.
 …
 Identifying approaching target. Searching Millennium student list. Target confirmed.
 Sensei! Your head is hidden, but your butt is poking out!
 (...)
 (This girl…She is different from the rest.)
 (I am feeling a new emotion. Is this…fear?)
 (Our probability of victory in a battle under current conditions is unequivocally… zero percent!)
 (All she has to do is look down, and…!)
 Correct.
 I present the object of our quest which will abate mankind’s destruction…
 …the legendary Mirror.
 TIme to pull out. I will guard the rear. Your orders, Sensei?
 Equipment set and ready to go!
 >>Battle<<

 Episode 17 | Just Getting Warmed Up
 [Millennium Main Hallway]
 H-Hey…Momoi.
 Midori, are you okay?
 Hey, Yuz–
 E-Everyone! I do not understand why…
 Is this…
 …is this because of the G.BIBLE?
 But… I do think the G.BIBLE was lying.
 Huh?
 ???
 [Millennium Game development Department]
 (Two hours ago…)
 Hmm…?
 Schale? I like Sensei being with us.
 But are you saying I cannot be with you anymore?
 Understood.
 G.BIBLE…
 …activated!

 Episode 18 | G.BIBLE
 [Millennium Game Development Department]
 The G.BIBLE… It is on!
 <Welcome to the world of G.BIBLE.>
 Oh!
 <...>
 <LOVE …	Video	… Games>
 Uh… Momoi, what about your daily quest?
 You always say that the dailies are more important than the end game.
 Hmm…?
 Midori…
 Ah…
 Wh-What about you, Yuzu…? Wait, where did she go?
 It is lieke…
 …everyone’s spirit have been debuffed.
 …
 You are wrong.
 I will not allow you to say that.
 I had fun every time I played Tales Saga Chronicle.
 Real, genuine fun.
 And I can feel it…
 I can feel how much Momoi, Midori, And Yuzu…
 …put their love into the game.
 When I play and travel in that world you made…
 Well… my heart pounds in my chest.
 Traveling in an unknown world with your companions at your side…
 You taught me what it means to dream.
 When I realize that our quest was coming to an end, a thought crossed my mind.
 ‘I wish this dream could never end.”
 It was all I could think.
 Sic days, four hours, and thirty eight minutes.
 96 seconds to be exact. Oh, 92 now…
 19 seconds remaining…
 …
 …*plop*
 I am waiting.
 People are starting to download the game. I want to know what they think.
 Well. I am just going to wait.
 …
 Understood.
 I am going to have Maki give me this person’s IP address so I can go blast them with a full strength laser beam.
 …
 My heart is beating really fast.
 Did Momoi’s heart just explode?
 Ranged attack confirmed. Position: eleven o’ clock. Distance: approximately one kilometer!
 Preparing counterattack!
 Yes.
 I must protect everyone.
 Midori!
 *looks from side to side*
 What about me?
 Oh, I recognize this situation.
 Uhhh…
 …
 Okay.
 So an arena event then? Understood.
 Last time, my strategies were limited due to the Mirror and limited area to move in.
 However…
 …this time my MP is fully charged!
 Did I kill her?
 Oh, of course. Situations like this call for more grace and nuance.
 Hath the fair maiden fallen in battle?
 AH!
 R-Recharging MP!
 Oh, n—
 *boom*
 Gah!
 Uh-oh…
 …
 *whoosh*
 Then, I will not aim.
 Here I go!
 Blinding Light!!
 *BOOM*
 Physical damage is 48 to capacity. We need to retreat!
 Eek!
 *scurries away*
 Um… Please keep anything wearing a maid outfit away from me from now on, please.
 Eek!
 …
 [The Millennium Award Prize Ceremony]
 …
 …
 Please be us… Please be us…
 I can’t take this.
 Laser is fully charged.
 …
 It’s okay.
 I know I can trust Sensei.
 However.
 That means…
 I can’t stay with you guys anymore.
 Hmm?
