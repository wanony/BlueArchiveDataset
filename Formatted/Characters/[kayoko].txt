 *sigh*
 *sigh* For crying out loud... Knock it off, Haruka. You're making a scene.
 I think she got the wrong idea.
 Maybe you should've thought of that before blowing all of our money on hired goons
 You could have negotiated to make sure there was enough left for four, you know…
 I get why you would want to reduce the risk factor of this operation. You're right about not underestimating the target. They aren't jobbers like the Helmet Gang.
 But really, Boss? Are these Abydos students really worth blowing our entire
 budget on hiring extra muscle?
 This is the first I'm hearing about a motto.
 It's a dish that adults like...and really expensive.
 It looks like it could feed ten people…
 (...)
 (Their uniforms...)
 (Should I tell her?)

 09 - Unrelenting Blood Feud
 Aru grapples with her feelings after realizing that the ones who treated her to a bowl of ramen were actually Abydos students. She resolves anew to attack Abydos High School with her hired guns.
 …
 Aru. Didn't those uniforms look familiar to you?
 Did you really not know?
 The hired muscle is waiting for instructions.
 (She really is conflicted right now.)
 *sigh*
 Agreed. It's regrettable, but business is business. We have to uphold our contract.
 Please. The title isn't nearly as impressive as you make it out to be.
 …
 Check out the look on her face. It must be the client…
 ...?!
 What was that all about? You're not planning on starting another fight, are you?
 …
 That would cost a year's worth of work just to be able to afford again.
 Remind me why we signed a lease for this office. It's a waste of money.
 …
 …
 …!
 The students from Abydos?!
 No, I don't think they're here for us... Are they being serious right now? They're sticking this place up?
 She has absolutely no clue…
 *sigh*
 Between those guys or the bank, there's no reason for us to help either side. And with Aru in that state right now...we're better off staying out of it.
 What kind of joke did we just walk in on?
 …
 (We ought to say something to her, but I don't know when or how...)
 Uh, no. I don't think so... They probably just forgot about it.
 Isn't...this...?!
 Now what?
 *sigh*
 <The truth finally dawned on Aru.>

 16 - The Truth Revealed
 What's eating at you this time, Boss?
 By the way. Haruka left first thing this morning to go plant the explosives. The plan is to pick off those Abydos kids off one-by-one with them. Does that sound good to you?
 <*opens*>
 Hi, Back. So...? How did it go?
 Because accepting payment in advance would give the client too much say in how we operate, or something like that?
 …
 You know, Boss...if this is getting to be too much pressure, we could all just throw in the towel and go back to Gehenna.
 That's a good point.
 The Prefect Team must see us as nothing but a thorn in their sides. Still,
 it's not as though we came out here to run away either. And don't forget.
 The only reason the Prefect Team is considered to be the most feared
 organization in all of Kivotos…
 Fade to black
 ...is because of Head Prefect Hina.
 Most of their firepower comes from the head prefect alone. She's like a one-woman
 army.
 In other words…
 ...the rest of the Prefect Team is anything but invincible.
 We have a puncher's chance of winning if we play our cards right.
 .We'll have to fight them sooner or later. We could use the same resources we're utilizing against Abydos to fight the Prefect Team without Hina.
 That's how strong I think the Abydos girls are. Their only real weakness is
 that they have no backup.
 Would you make up your mind, already?
 That place?
 I guess... I'll admit their food was pretty good. And a pick-me-up would do the boss some good.
 There isn't even a line. How do they not have more customers?
 I guess so. Not that I really care as long as the food is good. Let's eat…
 Hmm?
 Black screen
 Haruka! W-Wait a sec!
 *cough* *cough* What in the world...?
 *cough* *cough* What in the world...?
 This isn't how we planned for things to go, but this showdown was inevitable anyway, so…
 I'll go ahead and call in the hired thugs we contracted.
 Kayoko leaves
 …
 Wait. That's...!
 Scene change
 Explosion
 Boss! Mutsuki, Haruka! We have to get out of here! It's them!
 The Gehenna Prefect Team is here! Have they been tracking us all this time? And why now…
 No, wait. This might be them picking the perfect time to attack!
 <*KA-BLAM*>
 Gah!
 Damn it…
 <*collapses*>
 What you said about how doing this brings you no joy…That’s a lie. This is what you wanted all along.
 …
 At first, I was surprised the PRefect Team would show up way out here. Why go out of your way to another school’s district just to arrest some petty criminals like us?
 An inefficient and sloppy use of force like that isn’t Hina’s style. This was obviously a unilateral decision of yours, Ako.
 And you mobilized a platoon the size of a small army to take us into custody? Nah. You did it because you fully anticipated a hostile engagement with another school.
 But the entire student body of this school is only five students…
 Which leaves the only one explanation.
 (Closeup on Ako)
 Your true objective was Schale. What you wanted was Sensei all along.
 …?!
 *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp*
 (The troops keep moving)
 I thought we’d broken past their siege line, but now there’s a second…
 …
 Boss, this is our only chance to run. There’s no turning back once the battle breaks out.
 The Prefect team will attempt to wipe us and Abydos out in one fell swoop. But if the Abydos students draw their fire away, we may be able to break through one of their weaker points.
 Boss?
 …?
 (But we ran away from a fight just yesterday…)
 *sigh* So you’re gonna fight them? They’ll be tough to beat, even if we join forces with Abydos…
 Besides, there’s no way the Abydos students will cooperate with us. All that’s left is to-
 …?!
 Things certainly escalated quickly…
 You mean there’s more of them?!
 Ako shouldn’t have the authority to mobilize this many troops.
 Someone else must be backing this attack as well…
 No, that’s not what I said. Calm down, Boss…
 *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* *stomp*
 (Prefect Team troops move)
 What’s up, boss?
 *sigh*
 The money in the bag was left at the ramen place ro cover the repairs. Aru, you’re…
 *sigh*
 Our boss is so high-maintenance.
 Where should we go now?
 Sch-Schale’s Sensei?!
 Sensei doesn’t seem to have any malicious intent… Besides, we’re just about to leave. There’s no reason to be hostile now.
 Well…Yeah.
 *sigh* I only came back for more ramen. Why are we getting dragged into this?
 Our last explosives cut off enemy reinforcements. Now we can neutralize their commander to break the chain of command.
 Their soldiers will be completely disorganized. It’s the same tactic we had planned for the Prefect Team.
 Exactly as planned. Hopefully, the Prefect Team took care of their business.
 Aren’t you spoiling us again?
 By the way, Boss…are we really going?
 Fighting the PMC is a waste of time. We don’t have anything to gain from getting involved with this fight.
 Huh?
 …
 *sigh* This can’t be good for business.
 …
 Do we really have to do this, Boss? They’re making my skin crawl…
 *sigh*
 *sigh* I guess we’ve come too far to back out now.
 *sigh*
 This is gonna be a pain. Can we have one day of peace?
 …
