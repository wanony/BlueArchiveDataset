 We’ve lost, Azusa.
 It’s okay. It’s over now.
 She wasn’t going to let me live regardless of the outcome anyway. So it’s fine.
 Let’s end things here, Saori.
 Then let’s run away. Together.
 Yes.
 Azusa taught me something.
 The hatred we’ve carried for so long… is not our own.
 It was never ours from the beginning. It was instilled into us, and we falsely accepted it as ours.
 Azusa realized that before us.
 You’ve learned and experienced a lot while you’ve been gone.
 I can see now. You were blessed to have an excellent teacher, Azusa.
 And now Azusa’s found somewhere she belongs.
 So, Saori…
 … let’s run away together.
 Away from here. Away from Arius.
 Away from that hatred that is not our own.
 It can’t be…
 Has the doctrine been realized?
 We’re dealing with something beyond our level.

 EP 25 - Epilogue
 The Pandemonium Society recovers in the hospital, and order is restored to the Tea Party. Normalcy returns to life. Seia returns to the Tea Party, and the members have a dramatic reunion. Familiar faces gather at the new Make-Up Work Club. Meanwhile, an unknown presence targeting the Arius Squad goes on the move.
 Azusa…
 I expect you and your friends to continue learning and growing together.
 You’ll keep striving for a brighter future.
 I know you will because you’re strong.
 Even in a dark world where all is in vain.
 Even if you find yourself in the most desolate of depths.
 Azusa…
 I’m starting to understand your story about the flower.
 This is where we part ways…
 …but I do hope you find happiness.
 Fin.

 …Saori.
 Saori.
 You’ve all worked so hard. Thank you.
 You there. Your master is only after me, correct?
 I will come quietly. But let the others go.
 Saori, we’ve reached the end of the road.
 Say we do find some way to escape. What then? Where will we run?
 With Trinity, Gehenna, and Arius all after our blood?
 Nowhere is safe, Saori. There will be no rest for the four of us.
 Saori. Misaki. Hiyori. I hold all the blame here.
 So, please. Let me hold the responsibility as well.
 And that’s my decision to make. Saori, for the first time, I’m making my own choices. Please.
 Promise me you’ll free the others, and I’ll come with you.
 Swear on your name.
 Swear on your name you will not harm them.
 Okay. Then, I surrender.
 Everyone… Saori. Take care of yourselves. This is goodbye.
 Saori…?
 Good morning.
 Saori, Hiyori, Misaki... I'm back.
 Black screen
 Hi, Saori.
 I'm...right here.
 You... You came for me. You saved me.
 No more tears, Saori. I'm safe...thanks to you.
 Sensei...helped us?
 Yes. Everything is okay now.
 Sensei, thank you for helping us.
 ...I think I'll be fine.
 Madame was the one who gave me that mask.
 When I got caught in Azusa's bomb, some kind of a device protected my body. I believe it was from the mask.
 It must have been Madame's failsafe. To ensure I didn't die before the ritual.
 You're correct. I never want to have to hide my voice again...but I will keep myself safe.
 …
 …
 I do. I think.
 Saori, is there anything you want to do?
 …
 Is there anything you want to try? What do you WANT to do, Saori?
 Do you have a favorite food? You've never spoken of anything except protecting us.
 What do you want to be when you grow up? Do you have any dreams?
 Saori, you're responsible, strong, and…
 Do you think so? I can see it perfectly.
 …
 Black screen
 They will be. Sensei was okay last time.
 Yes, and every other time. Sensei will have a plan.
 Beatrice and all her powers suppressing the Arius district have disappeared.
 Saori? How are you feeling?
 We won't know until we try, Hiyori.
 From now on, every path we take is an unknown.
 Huh?
 Misaki…?
 …
 It'll be okay, Misaki.
 Saori will need some time.
 She needs to learn who she is, to reflect on her questions.
 She'll find the answers she needs on her own.
 Of course. She would never abandon us.
 Saori has taken care of us all these years. We owe her this much.
 Yes. I was prepared the moment we decided to live.
 I know. But we can do it.
 Wildflowers bloom through cracks in the concrete.
 Azusa said that to me once.
 We will continue struggling, even if it is in vain.
 If Azusa did it, so can we. We've been through a lot together.
 And this time, we're not entirely alone.
 Yes. We have our work cut out for us.
 Fade to black
 We'll have our happy ending.
 I have faith in the wildflower blooming in concrete.
 I have faith in you, Saori.
