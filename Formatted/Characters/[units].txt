 Hasumi, Tsurugi.
 Hifumi, Koharu, Azusa, Hanako. (And pretty much everyone else who appears in the below transcript)
 Hina comes out of her brief retirement after being visited by Sensei. Hifumi finds Azusa and decides to assume her identity as Faust to battle against the Arius Squad. A new ETO is formed after Sensei’s declaration and interpretation of the Eden Treaty.
 Hina, Tsurugi, Iori, Hasumi, Ako, Mari. (Also the Abydos Guys)
 Gehenna’s Prefect Team, Trinity’s Justice Task Force and Abydos join forces to face the Arius Squad.
 Hoshino, Shiroko, Nonomi, Serika, Ayane. (Also Iori, (Chinatsu and Ako) with some prefect team grunts)
 The Fight continues, and all of the schools that at first seemed completely at odds which each other slowly begin to work together.
 Hifumi, Koharu, Azusa, Hanako.
 The Arius Squad seems destined for defeat as the precept loses its power. Saori is adamant in her will to fight and doesn’t believe everything is in vain despite the members’ talk of throwing in the towel.
 Azusa (And all sort of special effects)
 Saori leaves the surrendered members behind and heads down to the basement of the old cathedral. Azusa and Sensei follow after her to finish the fight.
 INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
 Saori is defeated, and Azusa finally collapses from exhaustion. Atsuko then appears to personally admit defeat. Then, as if he had been waiting to strike, Maestro emerges and demands the doctrines hidden within Trinity’s depths. Sensei pulls out their card to retaliate.
