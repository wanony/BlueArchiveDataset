 Who the hell are these guys?
 They’re slicing through us like a giant, organized chainsaw!
 They’ve outnumbered and
 outgunned… But they’ve managed to push us back so far!
 Stand your ground! Reinforcements from the Security Bureau should be arriving at any minute!
 Once they arrive, we’ll just bulldoze them over! At the end of the day, there’s only three of them.
 I-Is that water?
 Which means…
 Augh! The firewalls are coming down!
 Doors shutting
 Don’t worry. We can operate the firewalls manually from the control room.
 We can just raise the firewalls and let in the reinforcements!
 It looks like a C4 explosive. But it has a modded lithium battery on top like an IED bomb.
 ...We’re toast.
 Explosion
 Clock ticking
