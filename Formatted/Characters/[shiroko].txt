 At least you're alive. I thought you were a goner when I saw you lying in the road like that.
 What's that? You fainted from hunger?
 Does that mean you're homeless?
 Oh…
 [Abydos Residential Area]
 *glances*
 You came here on business, but fainted out of hunger and dehydration when you couldn't find a single shop open?
 Well, that's hardly surprising.
 It happens all the time around here. It's been a long time since there were businesses open in this neighborhood that offer food and drinks.
 You would have more luck further toward the outskirts.
 You're not sure how to get there? So this must be your first time here.
 Hold on.
 <*rummaging*>
 Here. Have some of my energy drink.
 It's for cycling, but it's all I have right now. Better than nothing.
 Wait. Let me get you a cup or something.
 …!
 You weren't supposed to…
 Never mind. Don't worry about it.
 Um…
 You look like you're an adult from the General Student Council. Are you here on some kind of academy-related business?
 Ours is the only one around.
 So you're here to visit Abydos Academy?
 Oh. It's been a long time since anyone visited us.
 Let me show you the way. It's not too far from here.
 What? Too hungry to move?
 That's...a problem.
 But my bike only has one seat.
 …
 Fine. I'd rather do that.
 Let me just park my bike.
 Hop on.
 <*shuffle*>
 Wait.
 …
 It's just, I had been cycling for a while. I didn't work up that much of a sweat, but still…
 I usually have to take a shower at school afterward and keep a change of clothes there.
 Huh? You don't mind?
 You actually think I smell good?
 …
 What is anyone supposed to say to that? Whatever. As long as you're not going to complain.
 Let's go.
 *shuffle*
 Hold on tight.
 [Abydos Foreclosure Task Force]
 I'm back.
 …
 <*collapses*>
 Settle down—they're alive and breathing. They just came to visit the school.
 Uh…
 …!
 Those punks... They have some nerve coming back for more.
 Let's get going. Sensei brought us ammo and supplies to use.
 Sensei gave us the edge we needed to turn the tide. We couldn't have done it otherwise.
 Experience was likely the deciding factor. It was amazing how you handled resources, equipment, and support.
 We met before.
 ...Ignore what Hoshino said, okay?
 All the others either transferred or dropped out and left town.
 I don't blame them for leaving Kivotos entirely, with the state that Abydos is in. And now we have to deal with thugs like the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang trying to take over the school.
 It's too difficult to defend Abydos on our own, and embarrassing to see the state it's in, if I'm being honest…
 No. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they come back.
 True. The Helmet Gang's base is 30 kilometers from here. We have plenty of time if we leave now.
 Let's strike while the iron is hot.
 I bet they'll think twice before attacking us again.
 More like we can finally get back to more important matters.
 Hoshino is right, Serika. Sensei is responsible—trustworthy, even.
 All except for us, that is.
 So the school was forced to turn to loan sharks…
 …
 I can sympathize with Serika's frustrations. No one has ever cared enough to ask about our situation before, let alone reach out to help.
 We're not trying to pressure you. You've already helped us enough.
 True. Things are looking up, at least.
 Hey.
 Um... Or you can sit here if you want.
 Um…
 No, it should be fine. Right, Sensei?
 Hmm…
 So, how long have you been working here?
 One shio ramen.
 Thanks.
 Her boss said she clocked out and left like everything was normal. Did she never make it home?
 You don't think... Was it the Helmet Gang?
 A possibility, but let's not jump to conclusions. Hoshino and Sensei are still investigating.
 Did you find out what happened?
 It's more like an abandoned wasteland. There's no one there to enforce public safety, so there are a lot of outlaws skulking about.
 Likely still bitter over our last battle. Maybe they took Serika hostage as a way to retaliate.
 I agree.
 I have eyes on her! Repeat: visual on Serika! She's crying!
 False! I can confirm there were tears in your eyes just moments ago!
 It's too soon to let our guard down. We may have stopped the truck, but we're still in enemy territory.
 Yeah, we know. It's a refurbished Flak 41.
 I'll take her to the infirmary.
 Grabs and leaves
 Naturally.
 This is the only time we've had a meeting with Sensei in attendance, to be precise.
 …
 It's a scam.
 Interesting.
 So who's our target? Trinity? Gehenna? Or is it Millennium?
 We'll have to evolve our strategy to fit the target.
 I have an even better idea.
 We rob a bank.
 It's a surefire plan, and we already have the perfect target. Let's hit the First Central Bank downtown. -
 I've already mapped out everything from the location of the vault to the positions of the
 guards, blind spots for the security cameras, and even the armored car's transportation
 route.
 We can earn 100 million yen in five minutes flat. In-and-out, easy. Here, I even brought masks.
 Shiroko dawns her mask
 …
 *hopefully puts mask back on*
 Might as well go big or go home. Isn't that right, Ayane?
 …
 …
 Fade to black
 <Ayane continued to chew everyone out for a while.>
 Want some more chashu, Ayane?
 That uniform you're wearing is Gehenna's, right? That's a long trip.
 What? Is it the Helmet Gang again?
 So you're fixers, then.
 So, who hired you? Or are you not willing to tell us?
 We could always get it out of you by force.
 How much longer to go?
 …
 Glimmer
 Don't worry. I'm not.
 Fine…
 Is what they're doing officially recognized by Gehenna Academy?
 Like Problem Solver 68?
 Seriously. I was expecting a smaller operation, but this is like a city unto itself.
 I didn't realize an unauthorized district would be so big and so busy.
 Have you ever been here before, Hoshino?
 Gunfire.
 Scene change
 Footsteps
 Are you okay?
 Though I guess being chased answers that question.
 Hmm.
 Like a tank?
 Limited edition merchandise?
 …
 Yeah. Something that's out of production now and hard to find. But we heard we might be able to find it here.
 Well, if it's a fight they want…
 Are they going to bring reinforcements? Fine by me.
 I don't see why not.
 This place really lives up to its reputation.
 A kidnapping. Good thinking.
 *nom*
 Oh.
 You take one too, Sensei.
 It is pretty strange.
 …
 It looks like the real world isn't all sunshine and butterflies like we thought. I guess we were too sheltered within the safety of Abydos…
 Marching
 …!
 That looks like an armored truck full of cash they're escorting.
 What's going on?
 Infamous? Is it a criminal organization?
 Our cash payments are being funneled into this Black Market bank?
 …
 Hey. Yeah.
 No.
 There's no other way.
 It's our only option, Hoshino.
 … (glimmer)
 It's finally time.
 *shuffle*
 We're gonna hit the bank.
 Sorry, Hifumi. We don't have a mask prepared for you.
 It suits her perfectly.
 Would you do us the honors, Sensei?
 Everyone, down! Toss your weapons aside and hands where we can see them!
 I have the security camera blind spots, guard positions, and the bank's internal structure memorized. So nobody try anything stupid, or else.
 All right, you over there. That cash truck that just left. I want you to take this bag and fill it
 up.
 No, uh... What I want are the transport logs…
 Bank Examiner shuffles around
 Th-Thanks…
 Y-Yeah. The eagle has landed.
 This way. Hurry!
 I don't know about that…
 Yes. They're in my bag.
 <*whoosh*>
 No...? I asked for the logs, just like we planned. That bank employee is the one who got the wrong idea and gave us this cash.
 …
 I think you must be against this, Hoshino. So what else is there to discuss?
 …
 You heard her. President's orders…
 Are the Market Guards after us?!
 *puts mask back on*
 (Should we attack?)
 …?!
 Name…?
 Oh, well. I'm sure it'll end up with someone who needs it.
 Look at the truck's transport log. It says "Abydos - 7,880,000 yen collected". This has got to be the truck that came to our school.
 But right after that, it says "Kata-Kata Helmet Gang - 5 million delivered in mission
 funds".
 …
 I think this goes way beyond just a simple bank scheme. The only way it makes sense is if Kaiser Corporation's HQ is involved somehow…
 …
 We have been. It was a lot of fun.
 Ten kilometers? Isn't that downtown? Is it an ambush?!
 It's not a strategic location, and it's not part of a major transportation route. Why would someone...?
 We can try to guess what happened later. We need to get moving!
 …
 *click*
 What was that?
 If they're 50 millimeter mortar shells, then…
 The Prefect Team...!
 <<To be Continued>>
 20 - The Prefect Team Goes to War!
 Gehenna's Prefect Team declares their intent to arrest the members of Problem Solver 68. The Foreclosure Task Force prepares for battle, rebutting that Gehenna Academy-has no authority to make such an arrest on Abydos territory.
 [Destroyed Downtown Abydos]
 Yeah. They weren't targeting us specifically, but we were still in their bombardment zone.
 …
 We must be of one mind on this. We have to resist the Prefect Team.
 …
 …
 Your subordinates wouldn’t have any reason to be quivering in their boots right now if that’s all you were.
 …
 …
 …
 They definitely did that…but I bet they blew it up by mistake and then felt compelled to roll with it.
 If that explosion had really been meant for us, why set it off at the ramen shop when nobody was there? All that did was expose their plan, and make for a terrible trap in general.
 Regardless, it doesn’t change the fact they demolished the ramen shop. So again, we’re not handing them over.
 W-well…
 …?!
 Reinforcements.
 It’s nice that things are being kept simple.
 We shall become Sensei’s shield.
 President?
 …?!
 …
 Now’s our chance to try again.
 …U-Um.
 Okay.
 !
 But we defeated all of them.
 !
 What a shame. It was a good opportunity to fight some powerful enemies.
 …Sensei.
 I think the head prefect said something to you before she left…
 What was it?
 *Fades to black, flashback to what happened some minutes/seconds ago*
 …
 …Okay, Sensei.
 Then let’s go back.
 [TO BE CONTINUED]
 Episode 3 - Farewell, Problem Solver 68
 Hi, Nonomi. Sensei.
 …Where’s Hoshino?
 Um, okay.
 …
 …Sensei, how’s Master?
 …Okay, I get it.
 I’ll go back first, then.
 Don’t act like you don’t know anything.
 …
 …That’s a lie.
 U-Um…
 …This is between me and Hoshino.
 …I’m sorry, but please leave us.
 …
 …U-Um.
 True…
 Oh, u-um.
 …
 U-Um…
 …
 …
 ?!
 [TO BE CONTINUED]
 Episode 5 - Everyone Has a Story Part 2
 Does that include the Shiba Seki ramen shop?
 …!
 …!
 Hoshino… Did you know anything about this?
 Hoshino, you shouldn’t blame yourself.
 In fact, after the Student Council was disbanded, it was only thanks to you that the Foreclosure Task Force was established in Abydos.
 You may be lazy, but you’re always the first to take initiative when it really matters.
 Well, you may be annoying, but you’re also someone I respect.
 …Well, I just wanted to say it.
 …
 *fade to black*
 Obviously, they were in cahoots with Kaiser.
 It was Kaiser that lent the money to Abydos.
 Kaiser Loans lent the school more money than they could ever repay, forcing them to sell the land to keep up with the riding interest.
 Yes. That must be how it happened.
 …
 …Sensei?
 Kaiser is…
 Why would she tell you that, Sensei?
 …Hmm.
 …Sensei.
 Do you have a moment before we leave?
 …I have something I need to talk to you about.
 …
 Here.
 …I found it in Hoshino’s bag.
 *nods*
 It’s a letter of resignation from the Foreclosure Task Force.
 I didn’t tell anyone about this…but I’m sure Hoshino knows I went through her bag.
 …She’s never been away as long as she was when the Prefect Team attacked yesterday.
 I just couldn’t understand why she would do that, so I went through her bad and found this.
 …I’m sorry. I know that something’s not a crime just because I don’t understand it. I’ll accept any punishment you decide to give.
 Okay. Hoshino… I think she’s hiding something from us.
 *fade to black*
 Entrance of Abydos High School
 I disagree. The Prefect Team attacked first with clear intentions to invade. It doesn’t matter if it was in the Abydos district or not.
 And what Ako did after that was a clearly hostile act.
 That’s all we need to know.
 You’ve been here before?
 The Desert Festival… I’ve heard of it. It was the greatest festival in Abydos, and it would attract tons of people.
 Barbed wire and facilities that look like they go on for kilometers…
 U-Ugh… Maybe even more than the Prefect Team..
 …!
 And that rumbling must be from tanks.
 *sigh*
 …We’re screwed.
 !
 You’ve said enough. We know you’re the one who exploited our school.
 …!
 Yeah. How do you explain all these PMC soldiers?
 How are they not here to claim our district by force?
 …
 Abydos is our home.
 Just what is the Kaiser Corporation up to out there?
 I’m going. I need to find out what they’re doing out there.
 To that PMC facility. I shouldn’t have any trouble infiltrating it if I’m thorough. I’ll get to the bottom of what they’re using it for.
 …
 That debt isn’t going to be paid off by doing what we’ve been doing. Now’s the time for drastic measures.
 …
 U-Um…
 I didn’t mean to get so desperate. My bad.
 …
 Do you have a moment?
 O-Oh, okay. Got it.
 Sensei?
 In that case…
 (Shiroko disappears)
 We have to think about where Hoshino is. Rescuing her is our top priority.
 I’ll go by myself if I have to. In fact, if the task force won’t allow it, then…
 What was that?! It sounded like an explosion!
 Nonomi is right. Now isn’t the time to think about it. We need to move. Now!
 Enemy scout. They’re already here.
 …
 Where is Hoshino? Was you recruiting her all a lie?
 …
 …!
 We’re fighting back.
 Ayane…
 …
 They have a point.
 That’s right. Saving her is our top priority. Nothing else matters.
 …
 Welcome back, Sensei.
 We’ve been waiting for your decision.
 What’s our next move…?
 Agreed. We’re with you, Sensei.
 No, I’ll do it.
 But how do we defeat that army on our own?
 Is there anyone we can call for backup?
 That should do it. We’re ready.
 Yeah…
 Fire support.
 Not at all. We appreciate it.
 Follow up attack after receiving supporting fire. That’s standard procedure.
 …
 A school in the middle of a desert. This has to be…
 …
 …!
 Then, I’ll take a care of th-
 *baaaaaaaang*
 Now I get. They can’t hide how they feel.
 …!
 Yeah, thanks.
 Over there…
 Someone’s persistent.
 You’ve been manipulating all of us—especially Hoshino. That ends today.
 We’re glad you’re okay.
 Welcome back, Hoshino.
 At least the monthly interest payments have gone down.
 True…
 I have a better idea. Here—take a look at this.
 Yup. That’s our motto.
 She even held up a bank in the Black Market like it was nothing.
 Yep. That’s our Faust.
 I meant every word of it.
 Aw…
 All set.
