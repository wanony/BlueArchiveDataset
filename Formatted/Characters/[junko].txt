 Hey! Why the heck did we decide to hit a place like this?! We're in the middle of Trinity's district!
 Don't you dare drop that fish, Izumi! It's priceless!
 That's the TrinityJustice Task Force! They're just as scary as the Prefect Team. How are we gonna get out of here, Haruna?
 We're a lot closer to dying than eating, so get a move on!
 Scatter! It's every girl for herself!
 Junko whisks away
 *pant* *pant*
 I think I lost 'em.
 Akari appears, with a dark figure behind
 Um…
 Akari?! Why are you here? What happened to you?!
 A-Akari!
 The dark figure slowly approaches
 Wh-What is that?! A m-monster?!
 I don't wanna die!!!
 Junko fucking dies in an explosion

 Toss
 Haruna? You were caught too?
 …
 Since when was I sacrificing myself for that ditz?
 You're telling me! One of them crushed Akari like a soda can. I thought we were gonna die!
 I told you we shouldn't have come all the way here just for some stupid tuna!
 Enough with the stupid sink metaphor already!
 …
 What do you think they're gonna do with us?
 Akari! Don't just rise from the dead like that!
 A-Anyway. Is being handed over to the Prefect Team any better? May as well be delivering us to our executioners…
 Ugh... I think I'm gonna be sick.
 Where the heck are you two?! We managed to get away. Let's meet up already!
 What?! Why?!
 Come on! Try to keep up!
