 Heh. We finally found something that costs less than 600 yen!
 Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. We're only going to order the one.
 Well, isn't that nice of you? Don't mind if we do.
 Oh, and can you get us four pairs of chopsticks while you're at it? Thanks.
 Yeah! It's not like we're beggars. It's just because Aru blew through our cash.
 Really? You still want us to call you Boss when we're off the clock? And what kind of boss can't afford to treat her employees to more than one measly bowl of ramen?
 Just admit that you forgot to account for dinner in today's expenses, Aru.
 Aru probably doesn't even know. That's why she hired those goons—because she's chicken.
 Pretty sure she just made that up on the spot.
 Heh! You're so ambitious, Aru.
 What the...? This bowl is huge.
 I say we eat first and ask questions later. Chopsticks ready!
 Let's dig in!
 Black screen
 <*slurp*>
 Not bad at all. Who knew there was such a good ramen shop out here in the boonies?
 Huh? Weren't you sitting at the table next to us?
 (Hey, you're right.)
 (Something tells me Aru hasn't put two and two together yet.)
 (Nah. This is interesting. Let's see what happens.)
 Aru and Nonomi conversing
 … (glimmer)
 Those were Abydos students.
 …
 Black screen
 Hahaha! You should see the look on your face.
 Haha. It's a little late for that. We're gonna raid 'em in a bit anyway, so save it for then, Haruka.
 What's wrong, Aru? Isn't it time for us to get to work?
 Looks like our sweet little Aru is being torn ape
 What happened to doing the crime as long as the client has the dime? Problem Solver 68 doesn't let emotions get in the way, so what's going on?
 Let's move!
 Heehee! I really did appreciate that, but it doesn't matter. This is business, not personal.
 Welp. We're boned. I kind of thought we would have wrapped up by now. What now, Aru? Should we run for it?
 Haha. You sound like a corny third-rate villain, Aru.
 Wow! If it isn't Sensei! Hey there!
 Mutsuki nudges in
 How ya doin'? Wow, what a coincidence running into you this morning.
 *jump* *squeeze* Hmm? I'm not too heavy, am I? I'm sure you can still breathe, Sensei, so you'll just have to endure it.
 Blush
 Hey, quit pulling!
 Well, well, well. If it isn't Little Miss Four-Eyes from Abydos. You really like to stick your nose in other people's business, don't you?
 You seemed a lot more polite we ran into each other at the ramen place yesterday. Remember?
 What? It's not like we have anything against you guys.
 We told you it was just business. We can make nice when we're not fighting.
 Why not? It's not like Schale only works for you Abydos kids. Isn't that right, Sensei?
 Haha! That's a good one. Fat chance. We have a business to run. Aru isn't going to let us go unemployed or anything.
 Oh, well. Stop by our office anytime you want, Sensei. I bet Aru and the others would be thrilled to have you there.
 Well, bye-bye! See you next time, Miss Ayane.
 Whatever you say.
 Mutsuki leaves
 The heck, Aru?! Why aren't you answering your phone?
 Oof. I wouldn't want to be her right now, having to report a failure.
 Aru…
 …!
 You don't look so good, Aru.
 But those Abydos kids were way stronger than we thought. Plus, they've got Schale in their corner. We're not gonna be enough.
 And we've already spent our entire budget. How would we fight them even if we wanted to?
 She has a point, but I wouldn't really care if we started doing business out of a tent in the park like we used to.
 You can't be serious, Aru! I thought your credit was in the dumpster!
 Is that what happened...? Oh, now I remember. The Prefect Team did that.
 Try explaining that to the bank. We'd be laughed right out of the lobby!
 Heh. What in the world is she planning?

 13 - The Mask Swimsuit Gang! Part 1
 At the Black Market, the Foreclosure Task Force see their debt money being funneled into the Stygian Bank. Outraged that their hard-earned money is being used for illicit activities, the students plan a bank heist.
 [Black Market Streets]
 Zzz…
 Eek?! The heck?!
 Wait a second... Aren't they...?
 That's right. I'm not sure which is which, but it's gotta be them. The heck are they doing here? And what's with those masks?
 What are you doing, Aru?
 Scene change
 Is she actually getting teary-eyed?
 Wow, Aru is totally enraptured! She looks like a kid on a film set!
 Scene change
 …
 (Leave her be. It's way more interesting this way.)
 It feels pretty hefty. I wonder what's inside.
 <*click*>
 ?!
 No. Way.
 Whaaa?!
 Hahaha! Aru, you look like you just found out Santa Claus doesn't exist!
 Good morning!
 What's wrong with you, Aru? Did you stay up all night?
 The planning is all done, right? We hire double the muscle, then we lure the Abydos kids somewhere we'll have the upper hand.
 Nice! Just make sure to remember where they‘re all placed.
 What's wrong now? The money? If this was gonna put us out so much, then why didn't we get an advance from the client and use that for our plans?
 Really? Since when?
 Huh, was it? I guess it does sound a little familiar.
 Heh... The pressure must be eating her alive deep down, huh? She knows the Prefect Team would never let her off the hook.
 You don't say? I didn't realize you were thinking so far ahead, Kayoko.
 Huh. You don't say…
 Fine. Let's give this boring conversation a break and get something to eat. I'm starving.
 How does ramen sound? Shiba Seki, anyone?
 Worried about that part-timer? She only works in the afternoon. We just have to make sure we don't run into her.
 All right! Let's go! ♪
 [Abydos Foreclosure Task Force Club Room]
 <I was greeted by the sight of Hoshino resting her head in Nonomi's lap upon entering the club room.>
 We're here! Time to carbo-load!
 Maybe they need to move to a better location? They're right next to a failing school after all.
 What?!
 What has gotten into you?!
 And...? What's wrong with that?
 Geez, you don't have to be so serious about it…
 Hey, what are you doing with that detonator?
 *cough* Wow, will you look at that? The entire building's been leveled.
 *cough* Wow, will you look at that? The entire building's been leveled.
 How could you?! I can't believe you really did that, Aru!
 After everything the nice people at the ramen shop did for us, you blew everything up because you were starting to get a soft spot for them?! Geez, I didn't think you had it in you…
 You're as cold-blooded and ruthless as they come! An absolutely rotten, bad-to-the-bone
 evil villain! A complete scumbag!
 A real, hard-boiled outlaw! That was amazing! I had you all wrong!
 About time they showed up.
 Now what?! What's going on?!
 Who's "them"?
 Nice one, Haruka! ☆
 Yeah, technically, it is your fault. But I think it’s all right now that things are getting a lot more interesting.
 …
 (Aru trembles for a second, background disappears and changes to complete black. The screen focuses completely on Aru. Unwelcome School starts playing)
 …
 (She happy)
 You mean the head prefect gave the order after all?
 Don’t just stand there, Aru! Let’s get moving already!
 Huh? Wow, look at this! Aru worked really hard on this calligraphy! Throw it into the burning pile of trash over there.
 But it’s just your old calligraphy homework. “Do one bad thing each day”? What a strange message.
 You look so down, Aru.
 I don’t think Aru is happy to be moving out of the office.
 But we can’t let the Prefect Team know our location, and our clients are gonna come after us for failing the mission. What else can we do?
 The fight with Abydos also ended on a sour note.
 But that’s Aru’s charm! She’s so much fun to be around!
 Well, if no one has a plan, should we head back to Gehenna?
 Whoa! It’s Sensei! You’re here!
 Yeah! but Sensei’s always saying that we should get along.
 Yeah. It’s not like we’ll visit Abydos again. I kind of like this place.
 Sheets, Aru, lighten up a little. Little Miss Four-Eyes is the neurotic type. She can’t help it.
 Haha! But making my adorable Little Miss Four-Eyes cry is a pretty serious crime. Which is why…
 …I’m gonna rip these guys apart!
 Haha! What kind of villains would we be if we didn’t stab our employers in the back? You should’ve seen this coming!
 Whoa. Now THAT is what third-rate goons sound like.
 Wow, nice food stall!
 Calm down. Anyway, we heard you were closing down shop, so it’s nice to see you’re making a comeback.
 Haha! Don’t ask questions and just eat!
 Ah… That was good. All right. Should we roll out?
 C’mon, Kayoko. You still don’t get it?
 Can’t you tell by the look on Aru’s face? She’s saying, “Tasting ramen this good is the only compensation I need!”.
 …
 Heh heh…
 All right, Aru! Let’s go!
 Ta-da! We’re here! ☆
 We finally caught up to them, Aru! Looks like we might be interrupting something important. Anyone want to fill us in?
 Hey, what’s with those smirks?
 …!
 Oh, Aru. Keep that up and I’m going to fall head over heels for you.
 Don’t be like that, Aru! We’ve got no choice but to back it up after a cool line like that!
 *Close-up to Aru*
 Let’s tear ’em to pieces!

 Part 1
 Ahahahaha! You're really the best, Haruka! You definitely made your point!
 Those were some big, bad guys you blew up. Whatcha gonna do now, huh?
