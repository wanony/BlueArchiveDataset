 Um, Rin…
 I-I mean, Senior Administrator… I need to talk to you about something.
 Well, there’s an urgent matter.
 *whisper* The demolition of SRT Academy was scheduled today. However, just as they were about to begin, students occupied the park to protest the school’s closing.
 We didn’t have the manpower to deal with the sit-in…so the demolition is being delayed.
 Th-That’s what I thought you would say. I’m on it.
 Ayumu walks away
 Um, Senior Administrator…
 Well, you see…
 The Security Bureau was wiped out by the protesters.
 It is! It’s just one squad. Believed to be just four students.
 But SRT students are too well-trained and well-armed to be taken down by just the Security Bureau.
 I-If you say so!
 Ayumu whisks away
 Senior Administrator…
 Every last one defeated.
 According to the report, they couldn’t even get close to the park. They were taken out by snipers and booby traps almost immediately.
 To make matters worse, reporters from Kronos have picked up on the chaos and flocked to the scene.
 In other words, things are not going well!
 W-Well, Rin… I was thinking… We already have the Schale sensei here…
 You’ve read the reports too. Sensei has great leadership skills and they have the influence and authority to ask for backup from really whatever they want.
 With Valkyrie students taken out, I think Schale is our best hope…
 Momoka…
 Momoka, hush…
