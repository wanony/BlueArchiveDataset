 Hey, Serika. Ah, and Serika’s friend, Ayane. You’re here early.
 Even Sensei’s here. I’m fine, I’m fine. It was just a scratch.
 Well, I’m sorry I had to let you go, Serika.
 I was actually gonna close the shop soon anyway. It just happened earlier than I planned.
 Yeah. I already had an eviction notice from the building owner.
 …
 Actually, the Abydos Student Council couldn’t pay off its debt, so ownership of the building changed. I guess you didn’t know because it happened so long ago.
 Hmm… That name sounds right…but I’m not too familiar with all the documents and contracts.
 Oh, Serika. I saw a strange bag of money in the restaurant…
 E-Eh?
 Mmm. It’s just about ready.
 Shiba Seki Ramen actually got its start as a food stall.
 It wouldn’t have been possible had someone not left a large donation in front of my door.
 I was going to retire and live on easy street, but I guess they really wanted me to go back into business and work for a living. Inconsiderate if you ask me.
 Here, four bowls of Shiba Seki ramen. That’ll be 580 yen each.
 That’s right.
 What’s broken can be rebuilt.
 What’s important are the people who come to eat my ramen.
 This ramen shop isn’t going anywhere so long as it has loyal customers. Not the most poetic way of putting it, but that’s what I feel deep down.
 So go get ‘em, Abydos Foreclosure Task Force!
