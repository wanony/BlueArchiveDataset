 …I was wondering who the intruders could be. So it was Abydos.
 I didn’t think you would come here… Well, it doesn’t matter either way.
 *fade to black*
 You’ve damaged a business by illegally breaking onto its private property.
 I could leverage this transgression to double the debt your school owes, but honestly, that wouldn’t change anything…
 …Hmm, are you the Student Council president that Gematria was after? Oh, you’re the vice president. I see.
 Yes, yes. I have an interesting idea. It’ll be much better than using Problem Solver or the Helmet Gang.
 Hmm… You don’t know me? I’m disappointed, Abydos. I thought you knew me better than anyone.
 I am the chief executive of the Kaiser Corporation.
 And I am the one to whom the Abydos School owes its debt. In other words, I’m your creditor.
 Now then, let us discuss your old debt.
 [TO BE CONTINUED]
 Episode 11 - A Losing Battle
 Nowadays, I am also the CEO of Kaiser PMC.
 Hmm?
 My, my… Such spurious allegations.
 You break into someone else’s property, attack innocent Kaiser PMC employees, destroy facilities, and claim that it’s all because of me?
 Ha…Haha. That’s a good one.
 Let me make this clear. This is the legal place of operations of Kaiser PMC, and you are trespassing on private property.
 Regarding the Abydos district? It’s true. We did purchase it.
 Every step of that transaction was legitimate. We have the ledgers and records to prove it.
 I find it highly distasteful that you’re acting as if we’re committing a crime.
 Are you curious about what we’re doing here? Do you want to know why we bought your land?
 Then I’ll tell you. We’re looking for a treasure that’s supposed to be buried somewhere in Abydos.
 …
 Hundreds of tanks, hundreds of elite soldiers. Untold tons of black powder and ammo.
 Do you truly believe we prepared all this for a school with only five students remaining? Surely you jest.
 This is but a defensive measure against those who would interrupt our treasure hunt. It isn’t meant for you.
 All it would take to deal with you is… Yes, something like this.
 (Radio sounds)
 …It’s me. Yes. Proceed.
 I regret to inform you that your school’s credit rating has just taken another hit.
 Foreclosure Task Force Room
 *beep* *beep* (Phone sounds)
 …Hahaha.
 It is what it is. Now, do you finally understand who holds the rope around your neck?
 Do you find that too harsh? Ah, but there’s more.
 We never received a deposit for the 900 million yen you originally borrowed.
 Please deposit 300 million to Kaiser Loans within the week.
 You’ll have to prove that you can pay off the debt even at this interest rate.
 Assuming that IS even possible.
 In that case, you’ll just have to give up your academy and leave.
 Drop out and transfer. Isn’t that the right thing to do? The debt was never yours to begin with.
 It’s the school’s debt to pay. It isn’t your responsibility.
 Such foolishness. What do you plan to do? Continue to stand here arguing with us?
 Wise decision, Vice President.
 Now I remember. Your president wasn’t as bright as you, was she? Haha.
 I’ll be looking forward to next month’s payment.
 Hahaha!
 Feels good to laugh like that. Now, please show our guests to the entrance.
 Hahaha.
 At last—at long last, the final condition has been met.
 The last of the Student Council has dropped out, which means Abydos is no more!
 All that’s left is for Kaiser to annex the district!
 Capture the Abydos High School!
 My, my. Have you really come all this way to greet me? You saved me the trouble of visiting your school myself.
 Ha. Haha.
 The General Student Council? How amusing.
 How many times have you petitioned for the General Student Council’s help? How many of those prayers have gone unanswered?
 All of them. There is nothing the General Student Council can do.
 For that matter, has anyone else ever given you their aid? The other academies, perhaps? I doubt it.
 You have always been on your own.
 Takanashi Hoshino, the final member of the Abydos Student Council, has dropped out. That means that your student council no longer exists.
 You are nothing now.
 Because Abydos no longer has any official clubs, no Student Council, or even a district of its own, it has been deemed unsustainable as an academy town.
 Which is why, as owner of this district, the Kaiser Corporation will assume control of the academy.
 How does the Kaiser Training Academy sound? It’s a fitting name for the new school.
 She is correct. Unauthorized clubs don’t appear in official documents. You lot may as well be nothing but ghosts.
 Look on the bright side. Now you’re finally free from all the tedious debt.
 *Fade to black. The background doesn’t change. It stays black*
 *Chain rustling sounds*
 Hmm? Surely you aren’t serious.
 You actually intended to work for hundreds of years to pay off that debt?
 You can’t possibly be this deluded.
 Why did you remain here for so long? For what purpose?
 What?!
 *BOOM*
 What’s happening? The only people in that area should be Abydos residents!
 *A shadow appears in the distance*
 A-Aargh!
 You dare bite at the hand that feeds you?!
 You! It’s useless to resist! How dare you…?!
 …!
 Don’t be ridiculous! You’re just a teacher! You don’t have the right to…
 *Abydos and PS68 unite to look at the Kaiser Director with anger*
 *Aru is confused, Kayoko sighs, Ayako angy*

 *Problem Solver 68 & Foreclosure Task Force VS PMC Soldiers and Automatons*
 Part 2
 U-Ugh! I’m pulling out! Reorganize our forces!
 You…! You’ll pay dearly for this!
 Intercept them at once! Concentrate PMC forces there!
 Launch a pincer attack from the north and east! Send the Decagrammaton Defense battalion from the north!
 Impossible! Reinforcements from Abydos?!
 Correct. You’re standing before what was once the main building of Abydos High School.
 So you’ve finally arrived, Abydos Foreclosure Task Force.
 *More soldiers appear behind the director*
 Here stand the ruins of the Abydos High School, abandoned due to desertification. This was once the heart of the entire Abydos district.
 Whether you’re aware of its history or not, buried under this sand was once the largest and most influential academy in Kivotos.
 And it just so happens to be where Gematria requested we set up a lab.
 The vice president is in the building behind us.
 I would suspect the experiment has already begun by now.
 If you intend to take her back, you’ll have to go through us.
 You’ve been a real thorn in my side, Foreclosure Task Force.
 No matter what I did to erase what remains of that school!
 No matter how much it decayed or how hopeless paying back that debt was! You refused to leave!
 I’ve tormented you in every conceivable way, yet you still spend your days laughing and smiling without a care in the world!
 It’s because of you that my plans are…!
