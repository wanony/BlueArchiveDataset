 I can’t stand it anymore! I’m in agony! Torment! Misery! A-And it’s all your fault, Sensei!
 ...
 Wh-why am I the one being singled out?! You all failed too! If I’m dumb, then so are all of you!
 Idiots- the whole lot of you! That’s why you’re all in the Make-Up Work Club to begin with! You! And you! And YOU! And you too!
 Calm down?! We’re all going to be expelled! And if I’m expelled, I’ll be kicked out of the Justice Task Force. Anything but that…
 ...
 Get your head out of the gutter, you perv, or I’ll blow it off myself! Can you even hear yourself? That doesn’t even make sense!
 Wh…WHAT?! Back it up! P-Personal space! I don’t wanna know!
 No, let me go! Save me, Sensei! I’m sorry! I’m sorry…! I’m sorry I snapped at you Just let me go already!
 …
 …
 What?
 ...
 W-Who are you calling shy?! I’m just wary of strangers!
 …What brings you to the Justice Task Force?
 What?! You think it’s the Justice Task Force’s job to find missing people? This ain't the place for that. We don’t do volunteer work.
 Huh?
 A pink-haired woman wearing a school swimsuit suddenly appears.
 …?!
 Wh-What the heck?! How did you get out of your cell? I could have sworn I locked it tight!
 S-Stop making pleasantries and go get dressed! Who walks around in their swimsuit, you weirdo?!
 Y-You can’t wear a swimsuit on school grounds! That’s common sense!
 Huh? What kind of…?
 Don’t be ridiculous! Who said anything about a matter of preference?!
 Would you get back in your cell already?! My seniors will be here any minute!
 Shut up! Shut up! Just get in there!
 *pant* *pant*
 Isn’t it obvious?! The penalty for indecency is death! Summary execution!
 She was talking around school grounds in a swimsuit! In the middle of the day! In a plaza full of people!
 Why wouldn’t you wear your normal uniform?!
 Oh, you’re back, Hasumi. Mashiro.
 Never! On what grounds?! They’re shameless criminals!
 “B-But…Fine. If you say so. Hmph! Well it serves them right! What better punishment than being lumped into a Make-Up Work Club! How humiliating! Hahaha! A team of degenerates and outcasts! I would die of shame if I was forced to join a club like that!
 …Me?
 …
 Someone please kill me.
 …
 …
 You all…What did I do to deserve this? I refuse to accept it!
 Hifumi Wh-Wha…?
 I-I’m an elite member of the Justice Task Force! D-Don’t you dare look down on me just because I’m the only first-year! I’ll be out of this stupid Make-Up Work Club before you know, so don’t get too friendly!
 Great! Truth is, I’ve actually been keeping  a secret from you all…The reason I’ve been failing recently is because I was taking the second-year exam so I could skip a grade!
 Why?! Because I’m going to become the Justice Task Force’s ace!
 Sh-Shut up! That’s not what’s important! The point is that I’ve been hiding my true power. This time, I’ll take the first-year exam! I’m sure to earn an excellent award, aren’t I? After that, it’s farewell to the Make-Up Work Club!
 Wh-Who cares? I’m done with the Make-Up Work Club after the next exam! See you later, it was nice knowing you-that’s all I’m trying to say! I have it all figured out, so pretend like I was never here! Bye! Ahahaha! And good luck!
 Koharu leaves
 …
 N-No! Of course not!
 I-It won’t be?! I k-I knew that! I-I was just getting ahead, that’s all!
 …
 I don’t need luck. I’ll show you what it means to be elite, just you watch!
 *grun* This is…Um…
 11.
 …?!
 I-I can explain! The test was really hard…
 Failed
 Why does every scenario end with us sleeping together in the nude?! And there are plenty of beds, so stay in your own!
 We’re not here to study perversion! New lewdness allowed!
 …?!
 Stop right there, Hanako! No lewdness allowed!
 That’s because it’s written all over your face! Do you want the death penalty?!
 Seriously? Cleaning? Well, I guess if it’s just a little bit…
 Clothes to wear for cleaning? I guess my gym clothes would work.
 So now what…?
 NO! NOPE! ABSOLUTELY NOT!
 Why would you need to wear your swimsuit for spring cleaning?! It’s completely inappropriate!
 What are you talking about?! You’re supposed to wear a bathing suit in the swimming pool! Wh-What if someone sees?!
 No! Absolutely, 100-percent forbidden! You are forbidden from wearing a bathing suit from now on!
 Picking weeds? That shouldn’t be too hard.
 *cough**cough* There’s so much dust.
 I know that much! I’m used to taking care of rooms like this for the Justice Task Force! Put on a mask, use the duster, and wipe the rest away with a mop! I know how to handle myself!
 Yep, we're done! Everything is squeaky clean and feels so much more refreshing.
 That’s because we don’t! Why should we have to clean something we’re never going to use?!
 Wh-What are you talking about?! What girls?! You’re not making any sense!
 Are we really doing this?! It doesn’t have anything to do with our make-up work classes. Ugh.
 A-All right already! Just keep out of my personal space!!!
 The scene fades to black and back again. Hifumi and the rest of the club return in their school swimsuits.
 …
 Hold on just a minute!
 Why are you the only one still in the school uniform?! You told us to go get changed into something we wouldn’t mind getting wet in!
 What are you talking about?! You’re still in your uniform! Why is this the ONE time you choose not to put on that stup[id swimsuit you always wear?!
 Preference…?
 What do you mean “feels better”?! And for who?!
 Huh? You are…?
 Wh-Why are you asking me? Do whatever you want…
 HanakoL Heehee. Now, then. Is everyone ready?  Let’s get to cleaning!
 A CG of the Make-Up Work Club cleaning the pool takes up the screen.
 Why did we have to do this again…?
 It’s surprisingly pretty at night.
 *nod…*nod*
 N-No, I’m just…tired. Exhausted from today.
 Good night…
 Gah. The Justice Task Force would never abide by your indecency…
 Hnnngh…Morning already?
 I’m up already…
 W-Wait. Where am I? How did I get here?
 Wait, what?
 H-Hold on a second. Why…?
 Wh-Whaaat?! W-Wait. I can do that myself! You don’t have to undress me! Th-That’s cold! Aaaah! You’re getting shampoo in my eyes!
 *sniffle* She saw everything…I’ve been exposed…
 That’s not the point! You’re incorrigible! Don’t you understand how to be gentle with someone…?
 That’s even worse! Anyone but you!
 O-Okay.
 I’ll say! Why should we have to do that?!
 Gah…I know I’ve seen this before.
 15 Points (Fail)

 Episode 14- Justice Task Force Vice President Part 1
 It is nighttime in the annex classroom.
 The girls continued to study until evening.
 Wha…? Why me?
 O-Okay. Wait. I do know this one! For this…you need to draw an auxiliary line from the bottom at a right angle. Like this! Okay, so this triangle and this triangle are proportional to each other, right? Look here, see?
 …?! R-Right! I’m glad you agree. Feel free to ask for my help anytime you come across something you don't know. I’d be happy to help you.
 Wh-What did you just say?! That has nothing to do with it!
 Is it this one? This problem is a little…
 H-Huh?! No! But I’m sure I saw this in the reference book. Wait here. *rummages* Where did it go? I know it’s in here somewhere…Here!
 A book is shown. A woman and a man are in silhouette with a large disclaimer in the corner proclaiming R18 ADULT ONLY.
 Yeah, this is the one! Huh?
 Aaahhh! Wh-Why is that here?!
 Th-This isn’t what it looks like! It’s not mine! It’s not mine!!!
 N-No…I mean yes! I told you it’s d-definitely not mine…
 IT’S NOT LIKE THAT!!!
 *sniffle**sniffle* …
 *sniffle* Yes. Managing confiscated goods is part of my duties.
 *sniffle* It was an honest mistake. I forgot to turn it over…
 Now?
 Are you serious, Sensei?
 I WON’T!
 The screen goes dark.
 Koharu and I then left for the Justice Task Force club room.
 <<To be Continued…>>
 Episode 15- Justice Task Force Vice President Part 2
 The episode starts with koharu and Sensei out on Trinity campus.
 … J-Just to clarify, this really was all one big misunderstanding!
 Th-That…book. I’m usually better about hiding it. I-I mean, I don’t carry it with me.
 …?! What are you trying to say?! That breaking the rules is fine as long as you don’t get caught?! You’re supposed to be an adult! A sensei! Indecency is forbidden! You’re going to be sentenced to death! Death!!!
 …?! I-I…I made an honest mistake! It doesn’t count!
 I do say so! Are you mocking me?!
 H-Huh?
 …I-I don’t know what you’re talking about. But…I know you’re trying to look out for me….Hmph!  Okay! I’ll share an important secret with you in return!
 …The truth is…I’m a spy who was sent here to monitor the Make-Up Work Club’s progress.
 Simply put,. I’m carrying out a secret mission. I’m putting on an act adn am not really such an idiot!
 Wh-Who sent me…? Oh right. It’s, um…Hasumi! That’s right! Hasumi is the powerful vice president of Trinity’s Justice Task Force! A-And right above her is…President Tsurugi! She’s backing it!
 I-It’s because President Tsurugi is so brilliant! It’s like she can see 1,000 moves ahead. She’s a master of the pen and sword! Or, so I’ve heard. I haven’t been allowed to see her that many times…but I know it’s true. Now do you get it? I didn’t end up in the Make-Up Work Club because I’m actually bad at studying! I’m actually an amazing spy who is carrying out an Important undercover mission!
 …
 …?! Y-You wouldn’t expose my secret, would you, Sensei? I told you because I know I can trust you!
 *sigh* It’s done. I put it back where it’s supposed to be. Thank goodness it’s over. Now we can-
 A door handle clicks and Hasumi enters.
 H-Hasumi?!
 I know that, but the thing is, um…
 Come up with a good excuse.
 Y-Yeah.
 What? With m-me…?
 But that’s…for that. It’s too…The mission…too difficult…
 Yes. I…try…
 Koharu returns back in the room.
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Sensei. Let’s head back now.
 She can wash herself! She’s not a child!
 That doesn’t make sense at all! Prohibited! Completely prohibited!
 Stop corrupting her! Stop, stop, stop, stop!!! You’re nothing but a degenerate and corrupter! Trinity already has enough perverts running around!
 What gave you that idea?! Pools require swimsuits! It’s justice, and anything else is deserving of the death penalty.
 What are you whispering about?!
 …?! I-If it wasn’t a swimsuit, then what was it?
 …?! Are you saying that’s what it was? Don’t tell me you…!
 H-Huh?
 …?
 S-Stop talking in circles! Which is it?!
 Y-You just wanted to tease me the whole time?!
 Seia?
 *sigh*
 Ugh. Why did I get dragged out here too?
 W-Well, obviously! You couldn’t have done it all without me, and I worked hard too, y’know…
 Anyway. I told you all that you’re welcome to come hang out with me at the Justice Task Force whenever you want. I’m usually in the room where confiscated goods are stored…
 Kama…what? What’s that?
 Why would classic literature be banned?
 Wait, no! It must be something dirty if YOU were reading it! Burn it! Burn it with fire!
 Spoilers…
 It’s not that they’re bad—it’s just kind of cliché. Think of all the stories you’ve experienced where everyone lives happily ever after.
 What the hell are you talking about?! What kind of ending is that?!
 …!
 Yeah. I still wish Sensei could have joined us today.
 D-Don’t embarrass her! She obviously had to go to the restroom.
 The Justice Task Force was there… Are they?
 B-But…
 Wh-What's going on?
 Wh-Who me? But I…
 But I’m, um…
 Hifumi dots…
 B-But, Hifumi…
 O-Okay! I’ll see you later!
 U-Um…
 U-Um, excuse me…
 I, uh… What am I supposed to do now?
 Huh? My position?
 The contraband storage?
 Fade to black, switch to a gate of Trinity. Car sounds.
 U-Uh…
 I-I…
 H-Huh? Well, I, uh…
 But, I…!
 Scene Switch to Ruined building.
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 Bullying is illegal! She’s totally outnumbered!
 I won’t allow it!
 I-I know that, but…!
 I won’t!
 I-I may be kinda slow, and don’t fully understand what’s happening…
 …but I know this isn’t right! What you’re doing is wrong!
 S-Sensei?!
 S-Sensei… Is it really you?
 Sensei!
 Y-Yeah!
 …
 Y-Yeah! We can’t just leave her like this!
 I-I know what it feels like to be all alone too. To be left behind… We can’t just abandon her!
 We’ve all worked hard, but we only got this far because you were our club president.
 That’s right! Because she’s our friend!
 Hifumi?
 Worry about that later. We gotta get going!
 Fade to Seia again.
 …?!
 Is this really happening?!
 The hard work we put in to pass our exams will always have meaning!
 B-Be careful, got it?
 …
 Um, so I got a little overconfident and tried to enroll in a third-year class, and… yeah.
 Wh-What the heck?! Don’t you think you’re overreacting a little?!
 Cease! Stop trying to take advantage of the situation, you perv!
 Sexual Assault is punishable by DEATH!!!

 H-Hey, she's not the only one who improved. My score went up a lot too.
 Of course I did! I told you I've been holding back all this time.

 She did?

 That's how all of that started?!
 I can wash it myself, thank you very much!

 Hifumi steps closer

 04 - Swimsuit Symposium
 Rain drenches the Make-Up Work Club's laundry and they have no choice but to take a day off from studying and hold a swimsuit symposium instead. After experiencing their first enjoyable day in a while, they all decide to go out together on a nighttime walk.
 Raining noises
 Hngh... Good morning.
 What happened? She's usually the first one awake.
 What's wrong?
 Why did it have to come to this...?
 THUNDER!
 Even our gym clothes are wet now! They're sticking to me like they're covered in glue.
 …!
 I'm...out of clean clothes to wear.
 In your dreams, you perv! We're not gonna do something like that!
 Don't go along with her madness! We can't just wear our underwear to class!
 Not another word!!!
 Sigh
 We'll just have to do the laundry as quickly as we can and dry some of it with a hairdryer or something!
 In the meantime, we'll just have to make do with wearing towels! And Sensei can wait for us down the hall!
 We can put off studying for at least a few hours. Why are you so eager to hit the books all of a sudden?
 Why are you all so disappointed about not getting to study in your underwear?! Do you want to be executed for indecent exposure?!
 [Sensei’s room]
 <I decided to stay in my room until the laundry was done.>
 Thunder crash
 Lights go out
 Ahhh! What happened?!
 …?!
 Lightning flash
 Who cares about that?! Why are you all going along with this ridiculous symposium anyway?!
 I thought we agreed that we can't have class if we don't have any clothes to wear! Shouldn't we just go back to the dorm and rest until the blackout passes?!
 No it isn't! There's nothing educational about wearing swimsuits to class!
 Public indecency is still a crime punishable by death! That's all you need to know!
 Wh-Where's this coming from all of a sudden?! Don't just blurt out embarrassing things like that!
 W-Well, of course you should relish the opportunity to study with an elite like myself.
 Th-That can't be true! That's just an urban legend!
 Yeah, and they're all made up!
 Of course it is! Do you not have a lick of common sense?!
 Wh-Why would they only wear that?!
 And you just said they're a gang, so that makes them criminals! Of course criminals have no problem committing public indecency!
 No! I don't care what you have in mind—count me out!
 You've been going on patrols?
 …                        confused
 Lights come back on
 And the rain stopped too! Everything is clear outside!
 There's not gonna be a second! This was the first and last!
 Fade to black
 <Everyone decided to take a break after finishing the laundry.>
 <And so another day passed…>
 THUD
 Who are you talking to? Don't just start shouting out of nowhere like that. You almost gave me a heart attack.
 That never happened! Stop revising history!
 Th-That would be a violation. I can't do that!
 I-I mean, sure it does, but…
 You're fine with this?!
 You said we were going on a walk! Keep your clothes on!
 Fade to black
 <And that's how we decided to go on a late night stroll.>

 05 - Midnight Commotion Part 1
 The Make-Up Work Club runs into Hasumi at a dessert shop during their nighttime walk. Hasumi suggests keeping the encounter a secret due to each other's circumstances, but then receives a call that the Gourmet Research Society is causing a disturbance.
 Ugh. Why did I have to tag along? I'll be in for a world of hurt if Hasumi catches me out here.
 Th-That's because she is! Hasumi is kind, intelligent, strong, and carries herself with dignity and grace!
 Her temper is...just as peerless as her other aspects.
 Yeah. There was that one time…
 Flashback
 [JTF Club Room]
 Punching and ceramic breaking
 She was returning from a meeting with Gehenna's leaders about the Eden Treaty when suddenly…
 Flashback
 I heard Hasumi hasn't been eating very well ever since that meeting went south.
 Hasumi is a strong person, though! She's still keeping the vow she made, even after all she went through.
 I'm sure she'll be all right.
 Wh-Why the rush?!
 Um... I hope nobody sees me here.
 Koharu whisks away
 H-Hasumi?!
 Uh-oh…
 H-Hasumi…
 Well, um…
 Uh…
 But I don't think I can do it…
 How am I supposed to cram all of this in and get my grades up? I'm not cut out for this…
 All right. I'll try.
 Present
 Heehee. I wouldn't want to let you down, Hasumi.
 It's a promise!
 I'm going to fight alongside Hasumi...?
 O-Okay! I'll do my best!
 I-I hope I was helpful.
 Heehee.
 O-Of course I am! It was my first time.
 It was like a dream come true!
 I know that! I'm gonna ace the next one for sure. just like an elite would!
 Geez. You almost never get this fired up.
 W-Well, you're not going to do better than me! I'll show you the elite power of the Justice Task Force!
 I-I know this one! I just have to... Grrr..
 61 Points (Pass)
 This isn't a joke, right?!
 You did good too, Koharu. It was just barely above the line, but you still got a passing score!
 I-I'm not dreaming, am I? That's really my score...?
 See? I told you I've been holding back! This is what I can really do!
 …
 Same.
 It's creepy…

 <Morale was high as the group continued to study.>
 Fade to black
 <The day passed calmly and quietly.>
 Awww…
 M-Me too!
 Of course!
 Wh-Why are you getting so sentimental all of a sudden?!
 Y-Yeah! You can visit me at theJustice Task Force club room any time.
 Where's the exam going to be held anyway? At the academy's main building?
 What?! Why?!
 What the heck is going on?!
 What's this about being expelled?! What are you talking about?!
 That can't be right! Why would a Trinity club be sent there?!
 A-And we're gonna be expelled if that happens?! This is the first anyone's told me!
 We'll be expelled if we fail three exams?
 B-But I'll never be able to return to theJustice Task Force if I'm expelled!
 Uh-oh…
 Have you two lost your minds? This is getting way too weird!
 W-Wait! Don't leave me behind!
 What?! It's not like that!
 A-Aren't these the ones we fought just a couple of nights ago?!
 Stop shaking so much, Hifumi! I can't get a shot!
 I-Is that a forklift chasing us?! And a bulldozer?!
 The Prefect Team isn't far behind!
 I-Is this it? Did we come to the right place?
 Sensei! There you are!
 What about Azusa and Hanako?!
 Black screen
 …
 So this is the testing site?
 That voice belongs to the girl you've been talking about?
 R-Roger!
 Our exam papers!
 I can't take this anymore!
 What are we supposed to do?!
 Get your mind out of the gutter, you perv, or I'll blow it off your shoulders!
 H-Hey!
 Hanako steps forward again
 P-Personal space! Stranger danger!
 No, let me go! Save me, Sensei! Save meeeeee...!
 I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Just let me go already! This isn't how I want my first time to be!
 Stop being so wishy-washy! We need to come up with a plan!
 A top-ranking Tea Party official is gunning for us in case you forgot. We're screwed at this rate!
 Why is this happening in the first place?! What made her so hellbent to expel US?!
 I'm supposed to believe someone here is gonna betray Trinity?! That doesn't make any sense!
 I'll... I'll never be able to return to the Justice Task Force at this rate…
 *sob* It's hopeless. I worked so hard just to score a 61. How am I supposed to get my grade even higher?
 I worked as hard as I can already. I'm too dumb for this stuff. I can't... *sob*
 74 Points (Fail)
 90 Points (Pass)

 Me too! I'm not going down like this!

 Fade to black
 Less than 12 hours from the final exam.
 What are you all doing in here?
 Look who's talking! Tomorrow's exam day for all of us!
 Azusa ran off somewhere from the looks of it too.
 I can get why she'd be anxious, but…
 …?!
 Then how are we supposed to take our exam tomorrow?!
 That can't be right... I should try contacting Hasumi.
 …
 Are you sick or something? You look so pale.
 What are you talking about?
 …
 Wait. What's Arius?
 Your...mission is to kill her?
 Why tell us any of this? What's it got to do with us?
 I get a lot is going on behind the scenes between Trinity and Arius, but what's it have to do with our club?
 …
 …?!
 Wait, something still doesn't make sense!
 You said your mission was to assassinate Nagisa! Why do you suddenly want to protect her?!
 So you DID clean the pool in your panties! You admit it!
 …?
 Who said anything about doing that?!
 …
 Is it over?
 I-I've already contacted Hasumi! She should respond soon!
 H-How?!
 More Arius students arrive
 …?!
 …!
 I think so.
 Koharu stumbles
 I-I nearly passed out there.
 I forgot about that…
 But I can barely move my legs! Waaait!
 *huff* *puff* Can't...go...any...further…
 H-Hasumi wished me luck...?

 Do you think you could give these to a high-ranking person in the Tea Party for me? Please?
 Koharu gives something to Ichika
 They belong to someone from the Tea Party. They were in the Justice Task Force's contraband storage.
 Technically, yes. I was secretly taking items that were in decent condition. I know I'm not supposed to do that, but…
 Really? Thank you!
 Koharu runs away
