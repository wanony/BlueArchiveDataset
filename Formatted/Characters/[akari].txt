 The Medical Emergency Club is here? I thinkI may have dislocated my elbow. Would you mind taking a look at it? ★
 See you around. ★

 The Hot Springs Department caused an explosion in the middle of the city. It's a real cluster fudge.
 And wouldn't you know it? The School Lunch Club president just happened to agree to let us borrow the catering truck. Wasn't that nice of her?

 Buckle up, everyone. Off we go! ★
