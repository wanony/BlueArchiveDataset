 The Millennium Prize’s purpose has always been to award students for creating something practical.
 However, practicality fails to fully cover the emotions which can be brought on by an interactive experience.
 And so, for the first time in the history of the prize, we are awarding a unique top honor.
 Our Special Honors go to the Game Development Department’s Tales Saga Chronicle 2!
 We were charmed by a concept that transcended retro, a story not hung up on formalities, and a strange world which complemented both.
 Navigating a strange and unknown world, meeting new people, and overcoming a demon king.
 We believe it is a piece of work that truly captures the essence of the RPG genre.
 It’s a game that reminds us why we came to love video games in the first place…
 It is for these reasons that we saw fit to award the game with the Millennium Prize’s Special honors.
